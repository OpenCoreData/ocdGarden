ns3:002764be\-70ca\-3ec4\-a6f5\-7e0bc89ac8e9	ns2:abstracttext	"Palynological, sedimentological and geochemical analyses performed on the Villarquemado paleolake sequence (987 m a.s.l, 4030N; 118W) reveal the vegetation dynamics and climate variability in continental Iberia over the last 13,500 cal yr BP. The Lateglacial and early Holocene periods are characterized by arid conditions with a stable landscape dominated by pinewoods and steppe until ca. 7780 cal yr BP, despite sedimentological evidence for large paleohydrological fluctuations in the paleolake. The most humid phase occurred between ca. 7780 and 5000 cal yr BP and was characterized by the maximum spread of mesophytes (e.g., Betula, Corylus, Quercus faginea type), the expansion of a mixed Mediterranean oak woodland with evergreen Quercus as dominant forest communities and more frequent higher lake level periods. The return of a dense pinewood synchronous with the depletion of mesophytes characterizes the mid-late Holocene transition (ca. 5000 cal yr BP) most likely as a consequence of an increasing aridity that coincides with the reappearance of a shallow, carbonate wetland environment. The paleohydrological and vegetation evolution shows similarities with other continental Mediterranean areas of Iberia and demonstrates a marked resilience of terrestrial vegetation and gradual responses to millennial-scale climate fluctuations. Human impact is negligible until the Ibero-Roman period (ca. 2500 cal yr BP) when a major deforestation occurred in the nearby pine forest. The last 1500 years are characterized by increasing landscape management, mainly associated with grazing practices shaping the current landscape." ;

Stable isotope data and modeling and previously published estimates of Lake Edward's water balance are used to constrain the physical hydrology of the lake, and particularly the relative proportion of surface outflow to evaporative water losses. Stable isotope calculations suggest that Lake Edward loses roughly 50% of its water income by evaporation, while reviews of published hydrologic data together with our calculations suggest that evaporation comprises 54% of water losses. The similarity of these two sets of calculations lends credence to their validity, and provides a new water budget for the lake. Our results have important implications for the chemistry and hydroclimatic sensitivity of Lake Edward." ;

A pollen assemblage typical of superpuna plus low pollen concentrations, and % organics in the late glacial section of Laguna Tuctua indicate a cold/dry climate, but strong evidence for a late glacial climate reversal, i.e., the Younger Dryas, is not presently confirmed. An abrupt increase in Urticales pollen as Compositae and Polylepis-Acaena type pollen decline signals the beginning of the Holocene. Subsequent increases in Urticales and Plantago rigida type pollen point to increased moisture as well as higher temperatures from about 11,000 to 7000 yr B.P. A possible correlation exists between the rapid expansion of puna and closed continuous forest and the rise in importance of camelids in the early Holocene. In the mid-Holocene Plantago rigida cushion bogs and continuous montane forest elements decline, suggesting a drier climate. Grasses and Cheno-Ams then increase, reaching maxima about 4000 yr B.P. Pastoralism and agriculture are thought to have developed at this time, according to ethnobotanical studies from this area, and pollen evidence seems to support these findings. Between 3000 and 2000 yr B.P. pollen percentages of Poaceae, Plantago rigida type, and other local taxa decline as glacial activity was renewed in the higher mountains. Zea mays is present by 2000 yr B.P., and pollen of weeds and secondary successional plants associated with increasing agricultural disturbance are evident.  1994." ;

Here we report a new sediment age model framework for the last ~ 45 cal kyr of sedimentation using a combination of high-resolution radiocarbon dating, Bayesian age-depth modeling and lamination counting. Our results highlight the practical limits of these methods for reducing age model uncertainties and suggest that even with very high sampling densities, radiocarbon uncertainties of at least a few hundred years are unavoidable. Age model uncertainties are smallest during the Holocene (205 yr) and the glacial (360 yr) but are large at the base of the record (1660 yr), due to a combination of decreasing sample density, larger calibration uncertainties and increases in radiocarbon age scatter. For portions of the chronology older than ~ 35 cal kyr, additional considerations, such as the use of a low-blank graphitization system and more rigorous sample pretreatment were necessary to generate a reliable age depth model because of the incorporation of small amounts of younger carbon. A comparison of radiocarbon age model results and lamination counts over the time interval ~ 1530 cal kyr agree with an overall discrepancy of ~ 10% and display similar changes in sedimentation rate, supporting the annual nature of sediment laminations in the early part of the record. Changes in sedimentation rates reconstructed from the age-depth model indicate that intervals of enhanced sediment delivery occurred at 1619, 24 and 2931 cal kyr, broadly synchronous with reconstructed drought episodes elsewhere in northern West Africa and potentially, with changes in Atlantic meridional heat transport during North Atlantic Heinrich events. These data suggest that millennial-scale drought events in the West African monsoon region were latitudinally extensive, reaching within several hundred kilometers of the Guinea coast. This is inconsistent with a simple southward shift in the mean position of the monsoon rainbelt, and requires changes in moisture convergence as a result of either a reduction in the moisture content of the tropical rainbelt, decreased convection, or both." ;

Here we track the Laurentide Ice Sheet along a similar to 400 km long transect spanning about 6000 yr of retreat during the major climate oscillations of the lateglacial. Thunder Bay, Ontario is near a major topographic drainage divide, thus terrestrial ablation processes are the primary forcers of ice margin recession in the study area. During deglaciation three major moraine sets were produced, and have been assigned minimum ages of 13.9 +/- 0.2, 12.3 +/- 0.2-12.1 +/- 0.1, and 11.2 +/- 0.2 cal ka BP from south to north. These define a slow retreat (similar to 10-50 m/a) prior to major climate oscillations which was then followed by a factor of similar to 2 increase during the BbIling-Allerod, and an additional increase during the early Holocene. When compared to retreat rates in other terrestrial settings of the ice sheet, nearly identical patterns emerge. However this becomes problematic because a key control on retreat rates is the surface slope of the ice sheet and this should vary considerably over areas of so-called hard and soft beds. Further these ice margin reconstructions would not allow meltwater sourced in the Hudson Basin to drain into the Atlantic basin until after Younger Dryas time. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent work suggests asymmetrical Holocene behavior, with a relatively rapid early Holocene deforestation and more gradual reforestation later in the Holocene. This paper presents a new synthesis of the Holocene history of the Great Plains prairie-forest ecotone in the north-central US and central Canada that updates prior mapping efforts and systematically assesses rates of change. Changes in percent woody cover (%WC) are inferred from fossil pollen records, using the modern analog technique and surface-sediment pollen samples cross-referenced against remotely sensed observations. For contemporary pollen samples from the Great Plains, %WC linearly correlates to percent arboreal pollen (%AP), but regression parameters vary interregionally. At present, %AP is consistently higher than %WC, because of high background levels of arboreal pollen. Holocene maps of the eastern prairie-forest ecotone agree with prior maps, showing a rapid decrease in %WC and eastward prairie advance between 10,000 and 8000 ka (1 ka = 1000 calibrated years before present), a maximum eastward position of the ecotone from 7 to 6 ka, and increased %WC and westward prairie retreat after 6 ka. Ecotone position is ambiguous in Iowa and southeastern Minnesota, due to a scarcity of modern analogs for early-Holocene samples with high Ulmus abundances and for samples from alluvial sediments. The northern prairie-forest ecotone was positioned in central Saskatchewan between 12 and 10 ka, stabilized from 10 to 6 ka despite decreases in %WC at some sites, then moved south after 6 ka. In both east and north, ecotonal movements are consistent with a dry early Holocene and increasing moisture availability after 6 ka. Sites near the ecotone consistently show an asymmetric pattern of abrupt early Holocene deforestation (< 300 years) and gradual reforestation after 6 ka. Early Holocene decreases in %WC are faster than the corresponding drops in %AP, because the analog-based %WC reconstructions correct for the high background levels of arboreal pollen types that blur temporal variations in %AP. For example, at Elk Lake, the %AP decline lasts 1000 years, whereas the %WC decline occurs between adjacent pollen samples, approximately 300 years apart. Thus, early Holocene deforestation may have been even more abrupt than previously recognized. Rapid deforestation likely was promoted both by rapid climate changes around 8.2 ka and positive fire-vegetation feedbacks. Non-linear vegetational responses to hydrological variability are consistent with 1) other paleorecords showing rapid die-offs of some eastern tree species in response to aridity and 2) observations of threshold-type ecological responses to recent climate events. The 21st-century trajectory for the Great Plains prairie-forest ecotone is uncertain, because climate models differ over the direction of regional precipitation trends, but future drying would be more likely to trigger threshold-type shifts in ecotone position.  2009 Elsevier B.V.

The integration of sedimentary facies, elemental and isotopical geochemistry and biogenic silica, together with a robust age model based on 17 AMS radiocarbon dates, enables precise reconstruction of the main hydrological and environmental changes in the region during the last deglaciation. Arid conditions, represented by shallow lake levels, predominantly saline waters and reduced organic productivity occurred throughout the last glacial maximum (21-18 cal kyrs BP) and the lateglacial, reaching their maximum intensity during the period 18-14.5 cal kyrs BP (including Heinrich event 1) and the Younger Dryas (12.9-11.6 cal kyrs BP). Less saline conditions characterized the 14.5-12.6 cal kyrs BP period, suggesting higher effective moisture during the Bolling/Allerd. The onset of more humid conditions started at 9.4 cal kyrs, indicating a delayed hydrological response to the onset of the Holocene which is also documented in several sites of the Mediterranean Basin. Higher, although fluctuating, Holocene lake levels were punctuated by a mid Holocene arid period between 4.8 and 4.0 cal kyrs BP. A major lake-level rise occurred at 1.2 cal kyrs BP, conducive to the establishment of conditions similar to the present and interrupted by a last major water level drop, occurring around 800 cal yrs BP, which coincides with the Medieval Climate Anomaly. The main hydrological stages in Lake Estanya are in phase with most Western Mediterranean and North Atlantic continental and marine records, but our results also show similarities with other Iberian and northern African reconstructions, emphasizing peculiarities of palaeohydrological evolution of the Iberian Peninsula during the last deglaciation.  2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Sediments from Lake El'gygytgyn (67 300 N, 172 50 E) in Far East Russia contain a 3.56 Ma record of climate variability from the Arctic. Here, we present the first terrestrial Arctic reconstruction of environmental and climatic changes from MIS 8 through 12 (289 to 464 ka) using organic geochemical proxies. Terrestrial vegetation changes, as revealed by plant leaf wax (n-alkane) indices and concentrations of arborinol (a biomarker for trees), show increased tree cover around the lake during interglacial periods, with higher concentrations observed during MIS 11 as compared to MIS 9. A similar pattern is also observed in records of aquatic productivity revealed by molecular indicators from dinoflagellates (dinosterol), eustigmatophyte algae (long-chain (C28-C32) 1, 15 n-alkyl diols) in addition to short-chain n-alkanes, where aquatic productivity is highest during MIS 11. Changes recorded in these molecular proxies show a similar structure to relative temperature variability as recorded by the MBT/CBT (Methylation of Branched Tetraether/Cyclization of Branched Tetraether) paleothermometer, based on branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs). Additionally, relative MBT/CBT temperature changes generally track pollen and diatom 18O temperature estimates, compiled by other studies, which suggest glacial-interglacial temperature changes of 9 to 12 C. These records of environmental and climatic change indicate Arctic sensitivity to external forcings such as orbital variability and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Overall, this study indicates that organic geochemical analyses of the Lake El'gygytgyn sediment archive can provide critical insight into the response of lake ecosystems and their sensitivity in high latitude regions.

Based on TEX86 paleotemperature data from Lake Turkana, Kenya, we show that a temperature shift of 24 C occurred over the two millennia spanning the end of the AHP, with the warmest conditions occurring at 5 ka. We note a similar shift, though of a smaller magnitude, in other East African temperature records from Lakes Malawi and Tanganyika, as well as Mt. Kilimanjaro. Additionally, we document the temperature history for the last 220 years from Lake Turkana that indicates the thermal anomaly at 5 ka was warmer than the present day Lake Turkana temperatures and on par with modern temperatures of Lakes Tanganyika and Malawi. We suggest that the thermal response at the end of the AHP may be linked to local insolation during SeptemberNovember, when local air temperature rises to an annual maximum over Lakes Malawi and Tanganyika and a secondary maximum over Lake Turkana and Mt. Kilimanjaro. SeptemberNovember insolation peaked at 5 ka and likely caused air and water temperatures in the region to rise to maxima at that time." ;

Total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations in recent sediments from Lake Malawi range from 0.01 to 8.80 wt% and average 2.83 wt% for surface sediments and 2.35 wt% for shallow core sediments. Hydrogen index (HI) values as determined by Rock-Eval pyrolysis range from 0 to 756 mg HC g1 TOC and average 205 mg HC g1 TOC for surface sediments and 228 mg HC g1 TOC for shallow core samples. On average, variations in primary productivity throughout the lake may account for ~33% of the TOC content in Lake Malawi sediments (as much as 1 wt% TOC), and have little or no impact on sedimentary HI values. Similarly, ~33% to 66% of the variation in TOC content in Lake Malawi sediments appears to be controlled by anoxic preservation of OM (~12 wt% TOC), although some component of the water depthTOC relationship may be due to physical sediment transport processes. Furthermore, anoxic preservation has a minimal effect on HI values in Lake Malawi sediments. Dilution of OM by inorganic sediment may account for ~16% of variability in TOC content in Lake Malawi sediments (~0.5 wt% TOC). The effect of inputs of terrestrial sediment on the organic character of surface sediments in these lakes is highly variable, and appears to be more closely related to the local depositional environment than the regional flux of terrestrial OM. Total nitrogen and TOC content in surface sediments collected throughout the lake are found to be highly correlated (r2 = 0.95), indicating a well-homogenized source of OM to the lake bottom. The recurring suspension and deposition of terrestrial sediment may account for significant amounts of OM deposited in offshore regions of the lake. This process effectively separates denser inorganic sediment from less dense OM and allows terrestrial OM to preferentially be transported farther offshore. The conclusion is that for the organic carbon content in these regions to be elevated a mixed terrestrial-lacustrine origin is required. The hydrodynamic separation of mineral and organic constituents is most pronounced in regions with shallow bathymetric gradients, consistent with previous findings from Lake Tanganyika." ;

Here, we provide a new 500 year reconstruction of northern anchovy and Pacific sardine fish scale deposition rates (SDRs) and relative abundance from Santa Barbara Basin (SBB), through the transition from the Medieval Climate Anomaly into the Little Ice Age (AD 10001500). Three intervals of high anchovy biomass (high SDRs) were coincident with increased upwelling diatom abundance in SBB and cool/negative Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) events at 11301160, 12801310 and 14101450. Intervals of absent or low SDR of both sardine and anchovy in SBB sediments occurred in association with increased wave activity (benthic diatoms), California Current diatoms, and the relative dominance of sardine over anchovy. Thus although oceanatmosphere circulation shifts such as the PDO appear to play a role in shifting the dominance of anchovy over sardine, the biomass of sardines as indicated by SDRs has a more complicated response to environmental change." ;

Drilling targets included three holes in the center of the 170-m-deep lake, utilizing the lake ice cover as a drilling platform, plus one hole close to the shore in the western lake catchment. At the lake's center. the entire 315-m-thick lake sediment succession was penetrated. The sediments lack any hiatuses (i.e., no evidence of basin glaciation or desiccation), and their composition reflects the regional climatic and environmental history with great sensitivity. Hence, the record provides the first comprehensive and widely timecontinuous insights into the evolution of the terrestrial Arctic since mid-Pliocene times. This is particularly true for the lowermost 40 meters and uppermost 150 meters of the sequence, which were drilled with almost 100% recovery and likely reflect the initial lake stage during the Pliocene and the last ~2.9 Ma, respectively. Nearly 200 meters of underlying rock were also recovered; these cores consist of an almost complete section of the various types of impact breccias including broken and fractured volcanic basement rocks and associated melt clasts. The investigation of this core sequence promises new information concerning the El'gygytgyn impact event, including the composition and nature of the meteorite, the energy released, and the shock behavior of the volcanic basement rocks. Complementary information on the regional environmental history, including the permafrost history and lake-level fluctuations, is being developed from a 142-m-long drill core recovered from the permafrost deposits in the lake catchment. This core consists of gravelly and sandy alluvial fan deposits in ice-rich permafrost, presumably comprising a discontinuous record of both Quaternary and Pliocene deposits." ;

We advance a conceptual feedback model to account for the observed changes that includes previously ignored lake effects. Today Lake Titicaca serves to warm the local environment by about 45 C and also to increase rainfall. We observe that as water levels in the lake are drawn down due to warm, dry, interglacial conditions, there is a possible regional cooling as the lake effect on local microclimates diminishes. Positive feedback mechanisms promote drying until much of the lake basin is reduced to salt marsh. Consequently, the usual concept of upslope migration of species with warming would not be applicable in the Altiplano. If, as projected, the next century brings warmer and drier conditions than those of today, a tipping point appears to exist within ca. 12 C of current temperatures, where the relatively benign agricultural conditions of the northern Altiplano would be replaced by inhospitable arid climates. Such a change would have profound implications for the citizens of the Bolivian capital, La Paz." ;

Here we demonstrate that meltwater from permafrost ice serves as an H source to CH4production in thermokarst lakes, allowing for region-specific reconstructions ofDCH4 emissions from Siberian and North American lakes. DCH4 reflects regionally varying D values of precipitation incorporated into ground ice at the time of its formation. Late Pleistocene-aged permafrost ground ice was the dominant H source to CH4production in primary thermokarst lakes, whereas Holocene-aged permafrost ground ice contributed H to CH4 production in later generation lakes. We found that Alaskan thermokarst lake DCH4 was higher (334  17) than Siberian lake DCH4 (381  18). Weighted mean DCH4values for Beringian lakes ranged from 385 to 382 over the deglacial period. Bottom-up estimates suggest that Beringian thermokarst lakes contributed 15  4 Tg CH4 yr1 to the atmosphere during the Younger Dryas and 25  5 Tg CH4 yr1during the Preboreal period. These estimates are supported by independent, top-down isotope mass balance calculations based on ice coreDCH4 and 13CCH4 records. Both approaches suggest that thermokarst lakes and boreal wetlands together were important sources of deglacial CH4." ;

The high-resolution analyses attained in this study allowed to distinguish abrupt periods, identify the complex structures of the early and mid-Holocene and intervals and to compare their timing with Titicaca lake and Sajama ice records. Three main components in the lake sediments have been identified: (a) biogenic component, mainly from diatoms (b) volcanics (ash layers) from the nearby Parinacota Volcano and (c) endogenic carbonates. The correlation between volcanic input in Lago Chungara and the total particles deposited in the Nevado Sajama ice core suggests the Parinacota Volcano as the common source. The geochemical record of Lago Chungara indicates an increase in siliceous productivity during the early Holocene, lagging behind the rise in temperatures inferred from the Nevado Sajama ice core. The regional mid-Holocene aridity crisis can be characterized as a number of short events with calcite and aragonite precipitation in the offshore lake zones. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Moreover, a structural analysis of the bedrock fracture network based on a detailed map containing 898 fractures has been used to evaluate the influence of bedrock geology in the development of the glacier pattern. A detailed model of the deglaciation has been constructed by complementing the geomorphologic evidence with the chronological and sedimentologic study of a drilling core retrieved from the eastern subbasin of Sanabria Lake in 2004. According to this model, 10 episodes of glacier front retreat and stabilization took place after the local glacial maximum. Subsequently, a proglacial lake was established in the eastern subbasin of current Sanabria Lake, fed by ablation waters coming from the glacier front retreat. The proglacial activity was extended from a minimum age of 25.6 to 14.3. ka BP, in which the sedimentation of organic-rich muds took place until 13.1. ka BP. Subsequently, around 13.1 to 12.2. ka BP, a short advance of the Tera glacier is inferred from the deposition of coarser and less organic sediments. After this date, the glacier front would have retreated to the headwaters of the Tera valley. Sedimentologic and chronological data from another core retrieved in a moraine-dammed deposit indicate that a marginal lake would have been active since at least 22. ka BP until at least up to 10.5. ka BP to the north of Sanabria Lake. These results suggest a local glacial maximum prior to the global LGM and, therefore, new evidence of an early deglaciation in SW Europe.  2011 Elsevier B.V." ;

Here we used both neo- and paleoecological approaches to develop a fossil-based inference model for lake mixing depths and thereby refine understanding of lake thermal structure change. We focused on three common planktonic diatom taxa, the distributions of which previous research suggests might be affected by mixing depth. Comparative lake surveys and growth rate experiments revealed that these species respond to lake thermal structure when nitrogen is sufficient, with species optima ranging from shallower to deeper mixing depths. The diatom-based mixing depth model was applied to sedimentary diatom profiles extending back to 1750 AD in two lakes with moderate nitrate concentrations but differing climate settings. Thermal reconstructions were consistent with expected changes, with shallower mixing depths inferred for an alpine lake where treeline has advanced, and deeper mixing depths inferred for a boreal lake where wind strength has increased.

A previously developed model of the diatom response to lake-level fluctuations is used to constrain estimates of paleolake levels derived from the diatom data. High-frequency (decadal) fluctuations in the de-trended 18O record mirror variations in wet/dry cycles inferred from Banff tree-rings, demonstrating the sensitivity of the oxygen-isotope values to changes in regional moisture balance. Low frequency (multi-centennial) isotopic changes may be associated with shifts in the seasonal distribution of precipitation. From 200 B.C. to A.D. 800, both diatom and isotope records indicate that climate was dry and lake level low, with poor diatom preservation and high organic carbon: nitrogen ratios. Subsequently, lake level rose slightly, although the climate was drier and more stable than modern conditions. At A.D. 1200, lake level increased to approximately 6 m below present elevation, after which the lake fluctuated between this elevation and full stage, with particularly cool and/or wetter conditions after 1700. The hydrologic balance of the lake shifted abruptly at 1894 because of the establishment of a lumber mill at the lake's outlet. Spectral analysis of the 18O data indicates that severe droughts occurred with multi-decadal (50 to 70 yr) frequency.  2005 University of Washington. All rights reserved." ;

However, these records rely on accurate calibration with modern precipitation and hydrologic processes and only limited data exist on the controls on the -D values for nalkanoic acids from plant leaf waxes. Here we investigate the stable isotopic composition of modern precipitation, streams, lake water and ice cover, and use these data to constrain isotope systematics of the Lake El'gygytgyn Basin hydrology. Compound-specific hydrogen isotope ratios determined from n-alkanoic acids from modern vegetation are compared with modern precipitation and lake core top sediments. Multispecies net (apparent) fractionation values between source water (precipitation) and modern vegetation (e.g., quot;wax/precip mean value is ?10712 ) agree with previous results and suggest a consistent offset between source waters and the -D values of alkanoic acids. We conclude that although there may be some bias towards a winter precipitation signal, overall -D values from leaf wax n-alkanoic acids record annual average precipitation within the El'gygytgyn Basin. A net fractionation calculated for 200-yr-integrated lake sediments yields quot;30/precip = ?968and can provide robust net \"apparent\" fractionation to be used in future paleohydrological reconstructions.

Both Cleland Lake and Paradise Lake are small, surficially closed-basin systems with no active inflows or outflows. Lime Lake is surficially open with a seasonally active overflow. Water isotope values from Cleland and Paradise plot along the local evaporation line, indicating that precipitation-evaporation balance is a strong influence on lake hydrology. In contrast, Lime Lake water isotope values plot on the local meteoric water line, signifying minimal influence by evaporation. To infer past hydrologic balance variations at a high temporal resolution, we sampled the Cleland, Paradise, and Lime Lake sediment cores at 1-60 mm intervals (~3-33 years per sample on average) and measured the isotopic composition of fine-grained (<63 m) authigenic CaCO3 in each sample. Negative 18O values, which indicate wetter conditions in closed-basin lakes, occur in Cleland Lake sediment from 7600 to 2200 years before present (yr BP), and are followed by more positive 18O values, which suggest drier conditions, after 2200 yr BP. Highly negative 18O values in the Cleland Lake record centered on ~2400 yr BP suggest that lake levels were high (and that the lake may have been overflowing) at this time as a result of a substantially wetter climate. Similarly, Paradise Lake sediment 18O values are relatively low from 7600 to 4000 yr BP and increase from ~4000 to 3000 yr BP and from ~2000 yr BP to present, indicating that climate became drier from the middle through the late Holocene. The 18O record from Lime Lake, which principally reflects changes in the isotopic composition of precipitation, exhibits less variability than the closed-basin lake records and follows a generally increasing trend from the mid-Holocene to present. These results are consistent with several proximal reconstructions of changes in lake-level, precipitation amount, and precipitation isotopic composition and may also reflect the establishment of modern El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability in the late Holocene, as inferred from proxy evidence of synoptic ocean-atmosphere changes in the Pacific basin. Results from mid-Holocene (6000 yr BP) climate model simulations conducted as part of the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (PMIP3) indicate that in much of western North America, the cold season (October-March) was wetter and the warm season (April-September) was considerably drier relative to the late Holocene, leading to an overall drier climate in western North America with enhanced hydroclimatic seasonality. This is consistent with inferences from the Cleland and Paradise 18O records, which lake modeling experiments indicate are strongly influenced by cold season precipitation-evaporation balance. This also explains apparent inconsistencies between the lake 18O records and other proxies of hydroclimatic change from the greater Pacific Northwest region that are less sensitive to cold season climate and thus indicate relatively drier conditions during the mid-Holocene. The abrupt negative excursion at ~2400 yr BP in the Cleland Lake 18O data, as well as the marked shift to more positive values after this time, demonstrate that gradual changes in ocean-atmosphere dynamics can produce abrupt, non-linear hydroclimate responses in the interior regions of western North America." ;

ns3:0907f3e3\-7cc4\-33a1\-985b\-204bc6105211	ns2:abstracttext	"Kirchner Marsh and Lake Carlson are located 3 miles apart in Dakota County about 15 miles south of Minneapolis in the St. Croix moraine, which was formed by the Superior lobe during the Gary phase of the Wisconsin glaciation. During the Mankato phase that followed, the Des Moines lobe advanced to within a few miles of the sites. The region today is in a mixed-oak forest, with a maplebasswood forest 15 miles to the west and a re-entrant of the prairie on the sand plain south of the moraine. The general limit of coniferous trees is about 50 miles northeast of the sites, although outliers, especially of Pinus strobus, may be found along the Mississippi Valley a few miles to the east. One sediment core 12-13 m long from each site was analyzed for pollen content at 5-25-cm intervals. Diagrams based on percentage of total pollen (trees, shrubs, wind-pollinated herbs) show essentially identical sequences at the two sites, starting with the late-glacial phase of ice retreat. The diagrams have been subdivided into pollen zones according to the A-B-C sequence introduced by Deevey for New England. The late-glacial pollen record starts at Kirchner Marsh with a short Picea-Cyperaceae-Gramineae phase (Zone K), believed to represent a spruce parkland. Its C-14 date of 13,270 BP and the stratigraphy indicate a pre-Two Creeks and post- Gary correlation. Apparently the Kirchner site did not become established as a lake until this time owing to persistence of dead ice in the moraine. The absence of pollen of specific tundra indicators and the presence of pollen of such thermophilous plants as Fraxinus, Quercus, Corylus, Ambrosia, Humulus, and Typha latifolia imply that the climate was cool rather than cold. Zone A-a, which follows, correlates with the Two Creeks interstade. It is marked by the dominance of Picea, with appreciable percentages of Fraxinus and Ambrosia and with minor amounts of other thermophilous plants and the normal boreal associates of spruce like Betula, Larix, and Salix. Zone A-b, starting 12,050 C-14 years ago, correlates with the Valders ice advance. It is represented at both Kirchner and Carlson and shows the withdrawal of Fraxinus and Ambrosia and the slight rise of Artemisia. Except for the absence of pine in the late-glacial assemblage the vegetation implied by these three zones seems to have its closest modern counterpart in the southern fringe of the Boreal Forest of the Riding Mountain region of southwest Manitoba. It is concluded that pine did not migrate southward with the spruce during the Wisconsin glaciation, at least in the western Great Lakes region, and was thus eliminated from this region. During the lateglacial phases of ice retreat, herbs and spruce pioneered on the deglaciated terrain; pine did not follow until the destruction of the spruce forest at the end of the late-glacial phase. Zone B introduces postglacial time. It represents the time of rapid Vegetational succession following the deterioration of the spruce forest. Simultaneous maxima of Betula, Alnus, Fraxinus, and Abies occurred 10,230 years ago at Kirchner Marsh. These were followed rapidly by a Pinus maximum and then a rise of Ulmus, Quercus, and other deciduous types, dated as 9300 years ago at the correlative site of Madeha. This succession may represent differential rates of migration from refuges south and east of Minnesota. Deciduous trees dominate the C Zones. Zone C-a shows Ulmus and Ostrya /Carpinus followed by Quercus; it probably represents principally a mesic maple-basswood forest changing to oak. Zone C-b represents the advance of prairie into the region at the expense of the oak woodland or savanna. The large and abrupt fluctuations in the curves for Ambrosia-type and Chenopodiineae, especially at the Carlson site, may record encroachment of annual weeds onto intermittently dried lake bottoms. C-14 dates place Zone C-b between 7100 and 5100 years ago. In Zone C-c the Quercus again dominates until the abrupt increase in Ambrosiatype and Chenopodiineae that marks the time of forest clearance and land settlement 50-75 years ago.  1963, The Geological Society of America, Inc." ;

Recent changes in climate as well as changes in livestock management in the post-Soviet era may threaten the quality and availability of these freshwater resources and emphasize the need to characterize current conditions relative to a long-term baseline. Because diatoms are responsive to changes in water chemistry and are commonly preserved in lake sediments, they can be used as indicators of both present and past water quality. To these ends, we have developed a diatom-based calibration set and quantitative inference models for the region. Physical and chemical factors and modern diatom communities were sampled at 54 sites in western Mongolia in the Altai and Khangai mountains and the Valley of the Great Lakes. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) demonstrated that both salinity and total phosphorus accounted for statistically significant fractions of the variation in 151 diatom taxa across the 54 sampled sites. Diatom-based inference models were developed with weighted averaging (WA) techniques and showed strong predictive capabilities and low prediction errors for salinity and total phosphorus. These models are now available to help identify and interpret historical and future disturbances to this sensitive and globally important ecoregion.  Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008." ;

The standard model calls for the plume head to rise under northern Nevada and be forced northward to form basalts of the Columbia Plateau; subsequent movement of North America to the southwest over the plume tail created a hot spot trace on the surface. We present a new conceptual model for the origin of this feature that resolves inconsistencies in the current standard model and explains the recent documentation of a thermal anomaly in the mantle below Yellowstone today that plunges 65 WNW. Our model implies that the plume tail was forced beneath thinned cratonic lithosphere to the SE along with part of the plume head and has remained in this orientation for the last 12 Ma. We infer that almost all of the volcanism in SE Oregon and SW Idaho prior to 12 Ma results from overriding the southern extension of the plume head, not the plume tail, and that a distinct plume tail hot spot track was not established until formation of the Bruneau-Jarbidge eruptive center around 12 Ma. The plume tail track may also be controlled by a preexisting structural boundary in lithosphere that is thinner than adjacent lithosphere. This model demonstrates the potential importance of lithospheric topography on controlling the surface manifestation of plume volcanism and the complexity that may arise when lithospheric thickness is nonuniform." ;

Previous work has been able to explain variability in USA river-water and meteoric-precipitation oxygen isotope variability with geographic variables. These studies show that in the western United States, river-water isotopic values are depleted relative to precipitation values. In comparison, the controls on lake-water isotopic values are not well constrained. It has been documented that western United States lake-water input values, unlike river water, reflect the monthly weighted mean isotopic value of precipitation. To understand the differing controls on lake- and river-water isotopic values in the western United States, we examine the seasonal distribution of precipitation, evaporation and snowmelt across a range of seasonality regimes. We generate new predictive equations based on easily measured factors for western United States lake-water, which are able to explain 69-63% of the variability in lake-water hydrogen and oxygen isotopic values. In addition to the geographic factors that can explain river and precipitation values, lake-water isotopic values need factors related to local hydrologic and climatic characteristics to explain variability. Study results suggest that the spring snowmelt runs off the landscape via rivers and streams, depleting river and stream-water isotopic values. By contrast, lakes receive seasonal contributions of precipitation in proportion to the seasonal fraction of total annual precipitation within their watershed. Climate change may alter the ratio of snow to rain fall, affecting water resource partitioning between rivers and lakes and by implication of groundwater. Paleolimnological studies must account for the multiple drivers of water isotopic values; likewise, studies based on the isotopic composition of fossil material need to distinguish between species that are associated with rivers versus lakes.  2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd." ;

Here we use an empirical habitat model to evaluate the role of microclimate during a strong El Nino in structuring a tropical montane cloud forest's upper limit and composition in Hawai'i. We interpolate climate surfaces, derived from a high-density network of climate stations, to permanent vegetation plots. Climatic predictor variables include (1) total rainfall, (2) mean relative humidity, and (3) mean temperature representing non-El Nino periods and a strong El Nino drought. Habitat models explained species composition within the cloud forest with non-El Nino rainfall; however, the ecotone at the cloud forest's upper limit was modeled with relative humidity during a strong El Nino drought and secondarily with non-El Nino rainfall. This forest ecotone may be particularly responsive to strong, short-duration climate variability because taxa here, particularly the isohydric dominant Metrosideros polymorpha, are near their physiological limits. Overall, this study demonstrates moisture's overarching influence on a tropical montane ecosystem, and suggests that short-term climate events affecting moisture status are particularly relevant at tropical ecotones. This study further suggests that predicting the consequences of climate change here, and perhaps in other tropical montane settings, will rely on the skill and certainty around future climate models of regional rainfall, relative humidity, and El Nino." ;

It is the source crater of the Ivory Coast tektites. The structure was excavated in 2.1-2.2 Gyr old metasediments and metavolcanics of the Birimian Supergroup. A drilling project was conceived that would combine two major scientific interests in this crater: 1) to obtain a complete paleoenvironmental record from the time of crater formation about one million years ago, at a near-equatorial location in Africa for which very few data are available so far, and 2) to obtain a complete record of impactites at the central uplift and in the crater moat, for ground truthing and comparison with other structures. Within the framework of an international and multidisciplinary drilling project led by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP), 16 drill cores were obtained from June to October 2004 at six locations within Lake Bosumtwi, which is 8.5 km in diameter. The 14 sediment cores are currently being investigated for paleoenvironmental indicators. The two impactite cores LB-07A and LB-08A were drilled into the deepest section of the annular moat (540 m) and the flank of the central uplift (450 m), respectively. They are the main subject of this special issue of Meteoritics & Planetary Science, which represents the first detailed presentations of results from the deep drilling into the Bosumtwi impactite sequence. Drilling progressed in both cases through the impact breccia layer into fractured bedrock. LB-07A comprises lithic (in the uppermost part) and suevitic impact breccias with appreciable amounts of impact melt fragments. The lithic clast content is dominated by graywacke, besides various metapelites, quartzite, and a carbonate target component. Shock deformation in the form of quartz grains with planar microdeformations is abundant. First chemical results indicate a number of suevite samples that are strongly enriched in siderophile elements and Mg, but the presence of a definite meteoritic component in these samples cannot be confirmed due to high indigenous values. Core LB-08A comprises suevitic breccia in the uppermost part, followed with depth by a thick sequence of graywacke-dominated metasediment with suevite and a few granitoid dike intercalations. It is assumed that the metasediment package represents bedrock intersected in the flank of the central uplift. Both 7A and 8A suevite intersections differ from suevites outside of the northern crater rim. Deep drilling results confirmed the gross structure of the crater as imaged by the pre-drilling seismic surveys. Borehole geophysical studies conducted in the two boreholes confirmed the low seismic velocities for the post-impact sediments (less than 1800 m/s) and the impactites (2600-3300 m/s). The impactites exhibit very high porosities (up to 30 vol%), which has important implications for mechanical rock stability. The statistical analysis of the velocities and densities reveals a seismically transparent impactite sequence (free of prominent internal reflections). Petrophysical core analyses provide no support for the presence of a homogeneous magnetic unit (= melt breccia) within the center of the structure. Borehole vector magnetic data point to a patchy distribution of highly magnetic rocks within the impactite sequence. The lack of a coherent melt sheet, or indeed of any significant amounts of melt rock in the crater fill, is in contrast to expectations from modeling and pre-drilling geophysics, and presents an interesting problem for comparative studies and requires re-evaluation of existing data from other terrestrial impact craters, as well as modeling parameters.

We generated a new record of sediment geochemistry from Lake Towuti (2.5S, 121.5E), Indonesia, located in the heart of the IPWP, to investigate changes in hydrological connectivity with upstream lakes and the extent of lake mixing and oxygenation during paleoclimate changes over the last 60,000 years BP (60 ka). Lake Towuti is located at the downstream end of the Malili Lakes, a chain of large, ancient, and biologically diverse tectonic lakes occupying a geologically heterogeneous terrain in central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Major and trace element data from river and lake sediments suggest no changes in sediment provenance during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), indicating that some of the Malili Lakes remained hydrologically open despite a regionally drier climate. However, samples from the LGM are uniformly less enriched in trace elements than samples from the Holocene and Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS3), which suggests a decrease in weathering intensity during the LGM, likely in response to decreased precipitation and temperature. Changes in Fe and other redox-sensitive trace element concentrations indicate changes in water column oxygenation, with the highest oxygen availability occurring during the LGM (1535 ka) likely due to more frequent and/or deeper mixing of Lake Towuti's water column. The glacialinterglacial trend in lake oxygenation corresponds with changes in regional precipitation and associated changes in the seasonal cycle. The high degree of faunal endemism in these lakes may be related to changes in the lake geochemistry associated with glacialinterglacial environmental variability driven by changing inputs and redox variability." ;

Length distributions of n-alkane chains in modern plants growing at SL were determined and compared to sedimentary distributions in a core spanning the last 13 ka. As a group, submerged and floating aquatic plants contained high proportions of short chain lengths (< nC25) compared to emergent, riparian and upland terrestrial species, for which chain lengths > nC27 were dominant. Changes in the sedimentary n-alkane distribution over time were driven by variable inputs from plant sources in response to changing lake level, sedimentation and plant community composition. A shift toward shorter chain lengths (nC21, nC23) occurred between 3.1 and 2.9 ka and is best explained by an increase in the abundance of aquatic plants and the availability of shallow-water habitat in response to rising lake level. The late Holocene expansion of SL following a dry mid-Holocene is consistent with previous evidence for increased effective moisture and the onset of wetter conditions in the Sierra Nevada between 4.0 and 3.0 ka." ;

These terrigenous layers are interpreted as the result of extreme hydrological events that caused higher clastic input to the basin. Anthropogenic influence caused by fires or deforestation is rejected as the main factor generating these layers because human impact, inferred from the pollen reconstruction, was minimal when the terrigenous layers reached their greatest frequency. The reconstructed occurrence of these events in the Taravilla Lake record is coherent with the paleoflood history of the Tagus River, characterized by a notable increase of extreme events at the beginning of the Little Ice Age. The Taravilla record suggests a relationship between the occurrence of extreme hydrological events, solar variability, and the North Atlantic Oscillation for the NE Iberian Peninsula.  2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

Here we present a lake sediment sequence from the Canadian Arctic that records warm periods of the past 200,000 years, including the 20th century. This record provides a perspective on recent changes in the Arctic and predates by approximately 80,000 years the oldest stratigraphically intact ice core recovered from the Greenland Ice Sheet. The early Holocene and the warmest part of the Last Interglacial (Marine Isotope Stage or MIS 5e) were the only periods of the past 200,000 years with summer temperatures comparable to or exceeding today's at this site. Paleoecological and geochemical data indicate that the past three interglacial periods were characterized by similar trajectories in temperature, lake biology, and lakewater pH, all of which tracked orbitally-driven solar insolation. In recent decades, however, the study site has deviated from this recurring natural pattern and has entered an environmental regime that is unique within the past 200 millennia." ;

The differences in apparent age between TOC, pollen, and carbonate fractions are consistent and in accord with the origins of these fractions. Comparisons among different fractions indicate that pollen sample ages are the most reliable, at least for the past 15,000 years. The post-glacial radiocarbon data also agree with ages independently estimated from aspartic acid racemization in ostracodes. Ages in the red, siliclastic unit, inferred to be of last glacial age, appear to be several thousand years too old, probably because of a high proportion of reworked, refractory organic carbon in the pollen samples. Age-depth models for five piston cores and the Bear Lake drill core (BL00-1) were constructed by using two methods: quadratic equations and smooth cubic-splinefits. The two types of age models differ only in detail for individual cores, and each approach has its own advantages. Specific lithological horizons were dated in several cores and correlated among them, producing robust average ages for these horizons. The age of the correlated horizons in the red, siliclastic unit can be estimated from the age model for BL00-1, which is controlled by ages above and below the red, siliclastic unit. These ages were then transferred to the correlative horizons in the shorter piston cores, providing control for the sections of the age models in those cores in the red, siliclastic unit. These age models are the backbone for reconstructions of past environmental conditions in Bear Lake. In general, sedimentation rates in Bear Lake have been quite uniform, mostly between 0.3 and 0.8 mm yr-1 in the Holocene, and close to 0.5 mm yr-1 for the longer sedimentary record in the drill core from the deepest part of the lake.

Here we present an overview of 18 lake sediment 18O records along with a new compilation of lake water 18O and 2H that are used to characterize lake sediment sensitivity to precipitation-18O in contrast to fractionation by evaporation. Of the 18 records, 14 have substantial sensitivity to evaporation. Two records reflect precipitation-18O since the middle Holocene, Jellybean and Bison Lakes, and are geographically positioned in the northern and southern regions of the study area. Their comparative analysis indicates a sequence of time-varying north-south precipitation-18O patterns that is evidence for a highly non-stationary influence by Pacific ocean-atmosphere processes on the hydroclimate of western North America. These observations are discussed within the context of previous research on North Pacific precipitation-18O based on empirical and modeling methods. The Jellybean and Bison Lake records indicate that a prominent precipitation-18O dipole (enriched-north and depleted-south) was sustained between ~3.5 and 1.5ka, which contrasts with earlier Holocene patterns, and appears to indicate the onset of a dominant tropical control on North Pacific ocean-atmosphere dynamics. This remains the state of the system today. Higher frequency reversals of the north-south precipitation-18O dipole between ~2.5 and 1.5ka, and during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, also suggest more varieties of Pacific ocean-atmosphere modes than a single Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) type analogue. Results indicate that further investigation of precipitation-18O patterns on short (observational) and long (Holocene) time scales is needed to improve our understanding of the processes that drive regional precipitation-18O responses to Pacific ocean-atmosphere variability, which in turn, will lead to a better understanding of internal Pacific ocean-atmosphere variability and its response to external climate forcing mechanisms." ;

The Bonneville lake cycle began prior to 26,000 yr B.P.; the lake reached the Bonneville shoreline about 16,000 yr B.P. Poor dating control limits our knowledge of the timing of subsequent events. Lake level was maintained at the Bonneville shoreline until about 15,000 yr B.P., or somewhat later, when catastrophic downcutting of the outlet caused a rapid drop of 100 m. The Provo shoreline was formed as rates of isostatic uplift due to this unloading slowed. By 13,000 yr B.P., the lake had fallen below the Provo level and reached one close to that of Great Salt Lake by 11,000 yr B.P. Deposits of the Little Valley lake cycle are identified by their position below a marked unconformity and by amino acid ratios of their fossil gastropods. The maximum level of the Little Valley lake was well below the Bonneville shoreline. Based on degree of soil development and other evidence, the Little Valley lake cycle may be equivalent in age to marine oxygenisotope stage 6. The proposed lake history has climatic implications for the region. First, because the fluctuations of Lake Bonneville and Lake Lahontan during the last cycle of each were apparently out of phase, there may have been significant local differences in the timing and character of late Pleistocene climate changes in the Great Basin. Second, although the Bonneville and Little Valley lake cycles were broadly synchronous with maximum episodes of glaciation, environmental conditions necessary to generate large lakes did not exist during early Wisconsin time." ;

Assessment of drought impacts forecast by atmospheric models requires an understanding of natural drought variability, especially under conditions more arid than today. Using high-resolution lake-sediment records from the northern Great Plains, we show pronounced 100- to 130-yr drought cycles during the arid middle Holocene (8000 calendar yr BP). During drought phases, grass productivity declined, erosion and forbs increased, and fuel limitation reduced fire importance. Intervening humid decades saw grass production rise, with stabilization of soils and renewed fire as fuels became abundant. Although both C3 and C4 grasses declined during droughts, a lasting shift to C3 dominance occurred during a single drought 8200 calendar yr BP. During the more humid Late Holocene (2800 calendar yr BP), climate was less variable and without evident drought cyclicity. Consequently, drought severity during past, and possibly future, arid phases cannot be anticipated from the attenuated climate variability evident during contemporary humid phases. Our study demonstrates that agriculturally important grassland ecosystems respond sensitively to drought variability, uncertainty in which has profound implications for the future of these ecosystems." ;

Struvite is a biogenic mineral, unstable in most geological environments. The unusual size and preservation of these struvite crystals allowed us to perform a chemical and mineralogical characterization. This is the first record of struvite from a geological locality in Mexico, and one of the most remarkable in the world." ;

However, it is unclear how (or whether) these oscillations in the climate system are manifest in the Southern Hemisphere because of a lack of sites with suitably high sampling resolution. In this paper, we reconstruct the lake-level history of Lake Titicaca, using the carbon isotopic content of sedimentary organic matter, to evaluate centennial- to millennial-scale precipitation variation and its phasing relative to sites in the Northern Hemisphere. The pattern and timing of lake-level change in Lake Titicaca is similar to the ice-rafted debris record of Holocene Bond events, demonstrating a possible coupling between precipitation variation on the Altiplano and North Atlantic sea-surface temperatures (SSTs). The cold periods of the Holocene Bond events correspond with periods of increased precipitation on the Altiplano. Holocene precipitation variability on the Altiplano is anti-phased with respect to precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere monsoon region. More generally, the tropical Andes underwent large changes in precipitation on centennial-to-millennial timescales during the Holocene. Copyright  2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd." ;

However, the available evidence is inconclusive due to the existence of extended hiatuses and ambiguous chronological frameworks in most of the sedimentary sequences studied. This has given rise to an ongoing debate about the timing and causes of the assumed ecological degradation and cultural breakdown. Our multiproxy study of a core recovered from Lake Raraku highlights the vegetation dynamics and environmental shifts in the catchment and its surroundings during the late Holocene. The sequence contains shorter hiatuses than in previously recovered cores and provides a more continuous history of environmental changes. The results show a long, gradual and stepped landscape shift from palm-dominated forests to grasslands. This change started c. 450 BC and lasted about two thousand years. The presence of Verbena litoralis, a common weed, which is associated with human activities in the pollen record, the significant correlation between shifts in charcoal influx, and the dominant pollen types suggest human disturbance of the vegetation. Therefore, human settlement on the island occurred c. 450 BC, some 1500 years earlier than is assumed. Climate variability also exerted a major influence on environmental changes. Two sedimentary gaps in the record are interpreted as periods of droughts that could have prevented peat growth and favoured its erosion during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, respectively. At c. AD 1200, the water table rose and the former Raraku mire turned into a shallow lake, suggesting higher precipitation/evaporation rates coeval with a cooler and wetter Pan-Pacific AD 1300 event. Pollen and diatom records show large vegetation changes due to human activities c. AD 1200. Other recent vegetation changes also due to human activities entail the introduction of taxa (e.g. Psidium guajava, Eucalyptus sp.) and the disappearance of indigenous plants such as Sophora toromiro during the two last centuries. Although the evidence is not conclusive, the American origin of V. litoralis re-opens the debate about the possible role of Amerindians in the human colonisation of Easter Island.  2013 Elsevier Ltd." ;

The river's relatively pristine condition led to its designation as a National Scenic Riverway in 1968, but increasing urbanization in its lower reaches has raised concerns about impacts on water quality. This study was initiated to reconstruct historical loadings of suspended sediment and phosphorus (P) from the sediment record in Lake St. Croix. Twenty-four piston cores, with an average length of 2 m, were collected along eight transects of the lake. Dated chronologies from Pb-210, Cs-137 and C-14 were used to calculate the rate of sediment accumulation in the lake over the past 100+ years. Diatom microfossil analysis was used to reconstruct historical lakewater P concentrations over the same time period, and sediment P analysis quantified the amount of P trapped in lake sediments. Using a whole-lake mass balance approach, the loading of sediment and P to Lake St. Croix over the last 100+ years was calculated. Beginning in 1850, sediment accumulation increased dramatically to a peak in 1950-1960 of eight times background rates prior to European settlement. The peak is driven largely by sediment contributions from small side-valley catchment tributaries to the downstream half of the lake. The total P load to the lake increased sharply after 1940 and remains high, at around four times the level of pre-European settlement conditions. The timing of peak sediment and P loading to the lake shows that early settlement activities, such as logging and the conversion of forest and prairie to agricultural land between 1850 and 1890, had only modest impacts on the lake. By contrast, the mid-1900s brought major increases in sediment and P loading to the lake, suggesting that relatively recent activities on the landscape and changes to nutrient balances in the watershed have caused the current eutrophic condition of this important recreational and natural resource." ;

Inferred temperatures are compared with previously analyzed pollen data from each site summarized here by indirect ordination. Paleotemperature trends reveal substantial differences in the timing of climatic warming following the late Wisconsin at each site, although chronological uncertainty exists. Zagoskin Lake shows early warming beginning at about 21,000 cal yr B.P., whereas warming at Burial Lake begins 4000 years later. Summer climates during the last glacial maximum (LGM) were on average 3.5 C below the modern temperatures at each site. Major shifts in vegetation occurred from 19,000 to 10,000 cal yr B.P. at Zagoskin Lake and from 17,000 to 10,000 cal yr B.P. at Burial Lake. Vegetation shifts followed climatic warming, when temperatures neared modern values. Both sites provide evidence of an early postglacial thermal maximum at 12,300 cal yr B.P. These chironomid records, combined with other insect-based climatic reconstructions from Beringia, indicate that during the LGM: (1) greater continentality likely influenced regions adjacent to the Bering Land Bridge and (2) summer climates were, at times, not dominated by severe cold.  2008 Elsevier Ltd." ;

The sequences enabled an integrated approach to land-sea comparisons and, despite local differences and some minor chronological inconsistencies, presented clear evidence that the MCA was a dry period in the Mediterranean IP. It was a period characterized by decreased lake levels, more xerophytic and heliophytic vegetation, a low frequency of floods, major Saharan eolian fluxes, and less fluvial input to marine basins. In contrast, reconstruction based on sequences from the Atlantic Ocean side of the peninsula indicated increased humidity. The data highlight the unique characteristics of the MCA relative to earlier (the Dark Ages, DA: ca 500-900 years AD) and subsequent (the Little Ice Age, LIA: 1300-1850 years AD) colder periods. The reconstruction supports the hypothesis of Trouet et al. (2009), that a persistent positive mode of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) dominated the MCA.  2012 Elsevier Ltd." ;

By using benthic foraminiferal assemblages and their stable isotopic composition in two marine sediment cores located in the pathway of the IC on the West Iceland shelf we were able to derive bottom water temperature estimates at a -100 year resolution and define the temperature difference between the core sites throughout the Holocene. These are the first transfer function bottom water temperatures presented from the Icelandic shelf based on benthic foraminiferal assemblages. Our findings demonstrate a delayed Holocene Thermal Maximum in the marine current system around Iceland compared to the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation receipts. The maximum heat transport in the IC occurred between 8 and 4 ka years, later than some previous records report. A reconstruction of the ambient seawater delta O-18 based on paired samples of C2 transfer function temperature estimates and oxygen isotopic composition indicates repeated freshwater input to the N-Atlantic inflow in the early Holocene impacting the current system before 8 ka. Two fundamental regime shifts are evident in the paleoceanography and foraminiferal properties during the Holocene, occurring around 8 ka towards more stable conditions and again around 4 ka towards more unstable conditions. Increasing fluctuation with similarities to the Great Salinity Anomaly in the 1970s occur after 4 ka. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved." ;

Although diatoms are assumed to precipitate their frustule in isotopic equilibrium with their surrounding water, it is unclear whether internal processes of a given species affect the fractionation of oxygen between the water and the diatom. We present 18Odiatom data from two diatom size fractions (338 and >38 m) characterized by different species in a sediment core from Heart Lake, Alaska. Differences in 18Odiatom between the two size fractions varies from 0 to 1.2, with a mean offset of 0.01 (n = 20). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirms our samples consist of pure biogenic silica (SiO2) and 18Odiatom trends are not driven by contamination. The maximum offset is outside the range of error, but the mean is within analytical error of the technique ( 1.06), demonstrating no discernible species-dependent fractionation in 18Odiatom. We conclude that lacustrine 18Odiatom measurements offer a reliable and valuable method for reconstructing 18Owater. Considering the presence of small offsets in our two records, we advise interpreting shifts in 18Odiatom only where the magnitude of change is greater than the combined analytical error." ;

Here we present multi-proxy records from sediment cores taken in freshwater Hurleg Lake on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, which reveal millennial-scale lake-level and climate variations over the past 8,000 years. This high-elevation region is very sensitive to large-scale climate change, thus allowing us to better understand Holocene climate variations in East Asia. The lake-level record, derived from lithology, magnetic mineralogy, carbonate isotopes, ostracode shell isotopes and trace elements, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and gray scale data, indicates a highly variable and generally dry climate from 7.8 to 1 ka (1 ka = 1,000 cal year BP), and a relatively stable and wet climate after 1 ka. Superimposed on this general trend, six dry intervals at 7.6-7.2 ka, 6.2-5.9 ka, 5.3-4.9 ka, 4.4-3.8 ka, 2.7-2.4 ka, and 1.7-1.1 ka were detected from the high-resolution carbonate content and XRF data. The generally dry climate between 7.8 and 1 ka was almost synchronous with the decrease of East Asian and Indian monsoon intensities shortly after 8 ka. The six dry intervals can be correlated with weak monsoon events recorded in the East Asia and Indian monsoon regions, as well as the North Atlantic cold events. Our data suggest that millennial-scale monsoon variations could cause highly variable climate conditions in arid northwest China during the Holocene. These millennial-scale climate variations may reflect changes in solar variation and/or changes in oceanic and atmospheric circulation.  2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

Here, we compare climate simulations of four warm interglacials at Marine Isotope Stages (MISs) 1 (9 ka), 5e (127 ka), 11c (409 ka) and 31 (1072 ka) with new proxy climate data recovered from Lake El'gygytgyn, NE Russia. Climate reconstructions of the mean temperature of the warmest month (MTWM) indicate conditions up to 0.4, 2.1, 0.5 and 3.1 C warmer than today during MIS 1, 5e, 11c and 31, respectively. While the climate model captures much of the observed warming during each interglacial, largely in response to boreal summer (JJA) orbital forcing, the extraordinary warmth of MIS 11c compared to the other interglacials in the Lake El'gygytgyn temperature proxy reconstructions remains difficult to explain. To deconvolve the contribution of multiple influences on interglacial warming at Lake El'gygytgyn, we isolated the influence of vegetation, sea ice and circum-Arctic land ice feedbacks on the modeled climate of the Beringian interior. Simulations accounting for climate-vegetation-land-surface feedbacks during all four interglacials show expanding boreal forest cover with increasing summer insolation intensity. A deglaciated Greenland is shown to have a minimal effect on northeast Asian temperature during the warmth of stages 11c and 31 (Melles et al., 2012). A prescribed enhancement of oceanic heat transport into the Arctic Ocean does have some effect on Lake El'gygytgyn's regional climate, but the exceptional warmth of MIS l1c remains enigmatic compared to the modest orbital and greenhouse gas forcing during that interglacial." ;

Treeline ecotones, such as the prairie-forest boundary, represent climatically sensitive regions where the relative abundance of vegetation types is controlled by complex interactions between climate and local factors. Responses of vegetation and fire to climate change may be tightly linked as a result of strong feedbacks among fuel production, vegetation structure and fire frequency/severity, but the importance of these feedbacks for controlling the stability of this ecotone is unclear. 2. In this study, we examined the prairie-forest ecotone in south-central Minnesota using two lake sediment cores to reconstruct independent records of climate, vegetation and fire over the past 12 500 years. Using pollen, charcoal, sediment magnetic analyses and LOI properties, we investigated whether fires were controlled directly by climate or indirectly by fuel production. 3. Sediment magnetic and LOI data suggest four broad climatic periods occurring c. 11 350-8250 BP (cool/humid), c. 8250-4250 BP (warm/dry), c. 4250-2450 BP (warm/ humid), and c. 2450-0 BP (cool/humid), indicating that, since the mid-Holocene, climate has shifted towards wetter conditions favouring greater in-lake production and fuel production on the landscape. 4. The area surrounding both lakes was characterized by boreal forest c. 12 500-10 000 BP, changing to an Ulmus-Ostrya forest c. 10 000-9000 BP, changing to a community dominated by prairie (Poaceae-Ambrosia-Artemisid) and deciduous forest taxa c. 8000-4250 BP, and finally shifting to a Quercus-dominated woodland/savanna beginning c. 4250-3000 BP. 5. Charcoal influx increased from an average of 0.11-0.62 mm2 cm-2 year-1 during the early Holocene forest period (c. 11 350-8250 BP) to 1.71-3.36 mm2 cm-2 year-1 during the period of prairie expansion (c. 8250-4250 BP) and again increased to 4.18-4.90 mm2 cm-2 year-1 at the start of the woodland/savanna period (c. 4250 BP). 6. As a result of the influence of climate on community composition and fuel productivity, changes in fire severity may be the result and not the cause of shifts in vegetation." ;

The late Glacial to early Holocene climate in the northern Great Plains was characterized by changes from cold and wet to cold and dry, and back to cold and wet conditions. These climatic changes were controlled by fluctuations in the positions of the Laurentide ice sheet and the extent of glacial Lake Agassiz. We speculate that the cold and dry phase may correspond to the Younger Dryas event. A salinity maximum was reached between 10.3 and 9.5 ka, after which Pickerel Lake shifted from a system controlled by atmospheric changes to a system controlled by groundwater seepage that might have been initiated by the final withdrawal of Glacial Lake Agassiz. A prairie lake was established at approximately 8.7 ka, and lasted until about 2.2 ka. During this mid-Holocene prairie period, drier conditions than today prevailed, interrupted by periods of increased moisture at about 8, 4, and 2.2 ka. Prairie conditions were more likely dry and cool rather than dry and warm. The last 2.2 ka are characterized by higher climatic variability with 400-yr aridity cycles including the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age. Although the signal of changing atmospheric circulation is overprinted by fluctuations in the positions of the ice sheet and glacial Lake Agassiz during the late Glacial-Holocene transition, a combination of strong zonal circulation and strong monsoons induced by the presence of the ice sheet and high insolation may have provided mechanisms for increased precipitation. Zonal flow introducing dry Pacific air became more important during the prairie period but seems to have been interrupted by short periods of stronger meridional circulation with intrusions of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. More frequent switching between periods of zonal and meridional circulation seem to be responsible for increased climatic variability during the last 2.2 ka." ;

However, evaluation of the long-standing hypotheses about the region's environmental history has been hampered by the scarcity of paleorecords. We conducted multiproxy analyses on early and middle Holocene sediments from two Illinois, USA, lakes to assess long-term climatic, vegetational, and fire variability in the region. Sediment mineral composition, carbonate 18O, ostracode assemblages, and diatom assemblages were integrated to infer fluctuations in moisture availability. Pollen and charcoal 13C were used to reconstruct vegetation composition, and charcoal influx was used to reconstruct fire. Results indicate that fire-sensitive trees (e.g., Ulmus, Ostrya, Fraxinus, and Acer saccharum) declined and prairie taxa expanded with increased aridity from 10 000 yr BP to 8500 yr BP. Between 8500 yr BP and 6200 yr BP, aridity declined, and prairie coexisted with fire-sensitive and fire-tolerant (e.g., Quercus and Carya) trees. After 6200 yr BP, prairie taxa became dominant, although aridity was not more severe than it was around 8500 yr BP. Along with aridity, fire appears to have played an important role in the establishment and maintenance of prairie communities in the eastern Prairie Peninsula, consistent with the speculations of the early ecologists. Comparison of our data with results from elsewhere in the North American midcontinent indicates that spatial heterogeneity is a characteristic feature of climatic and vegetational variations on millennial time scales.  2006 by the Ecological Society of America." ;

Here we present a 5400-year geochemical record of rainfall and drought from Lake Edward in equatorial Africa. We observe a non-linear correlation in which drought in equatorial Africa occurs during both cold and warm extremes in the North Atlantic's 1500-year quasi-cycle. We propose that this relationship occurs due to northward/ southward displacement of the ITCZ from its equatorial mean position during warm/cold events. Our results show that millennial-scale high-latitude climate events are linked to changes in equatorial terrestrial climate even during the late Holocene and suggest important constraints on the mechanisms linking tropical and extratropical climate variability.

Here, we outline major shifts in the climate and ecosystem of tropical East Africa for the past 60,000 years (60 ka) by examining molecular records of hydrology, vegetation, and temperature from a sediment sequence from Lake Tanganyika. We demonstrate, via comparison with pollen spectra, that stable carbon isotopes measured on higher plant leaf waxes ([delta]13Cwax) are a reliable proxy for vegetation change. In addition we argue that the D/H ratio of higher plant leaf waxes ([delta]Dwax) is a robust and independent indicator of past changes in aridity, and is not affected by regional vegetation change directly. Our paired, compound-specific isotope data show that shifts in vegetation lead major changes in hydrology in the Tanganyika basin at several major climate transitions during the past 60,000 years, suggesting that vegetation in the Tanganyika basin is not as sensitive to aridity as previous studies have suggested and that variations in carbon dioxide, temperature, and internal ecosystem dynamics are equally, if not more, important. We hypothesize that regional vegetation change may exert a positive feedback on regional hydrology, thus partially accounting for the abrupt threshold behavior evident in our paleohydrological data. Furthermore, we find that past changes in Tanganyika basin climate and ecology are closely linked to concentrations of atmospheric trace gases, highlighting the paramount influence of global climatic shifts upon regional tropical climate over glacial/interglacial timescales." ;

The acoustic stratigraphy is tied to a 120 m deep, continuously cored drill hole in the lake. Based on the age model for the drill core, the oldest continuously mapped acoustic reflector in the data set has an age of about 100 ka, although older sediments were locally imaged. The acoustic stratigraphy of the sediments below the lake indicates that the basin developed primarily as a simple half-graben, with a steep normal-fault margin on the east and a flexural margin on the west. As expected for a basin controlled by a listric master fault, seismic reflections steepen and diverge toward the fault, bounding eastward-thickening sediment wedges. Secondary normal faults west of the master fault were imaged beneath the lake and many of these faults show progressively increasing offset with depth and age. Several faults cut the youngest sediments in the lake as well as the modern lake floor. The relative simplicity of the sedimentary sequence is interrupted in the northwestern part of the basin by a unit that is interpreted as a large (4  10 km) paleodelta of the Bear River. The delta overlies a horizon with an age of about 97 ka, outcrops at the lake floor and is onlapped by much of the uppermost sequence of lake sediments. A feature interpreted as a wave-cut bench occurs in many places on the western side of the lake. The base of this bench occurs at a depth (22-24 m) similar to that (20-25 m) of the distal surface of the paleodelta. Pinch-outs of sedimentary units are common in relatively shallow water on the gentle western margin of the basin and little Holocene sediment has accumulated in water depths of less than 30 m. On the steep eastern margin of the basin, sediments commonly onlap the hanging wall of the East Bear Lake Fault. However, no major erosional or depositional features suggestive of shoreline processes were observed on acoustic profiles in water deeper than about 20-25 m." ;

Three partly overlapping holes were drilled into the 320 m long sediment record at International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) Site 5011-1 in the lake basin, recovering the Quaternary almost completely, and the Pliocene down to 3.6 Ma with 52% recovery. Mass movement deposits were investigated in all three cores, based on macroscopical core descriptions, radiographic images, high-resolution magnetic susceptibility and gamma-ray density. Five different types of MMDs were identified: turbidites, grain-flow deposits, debrites, slumps and slides. These are formed by transitional mass movement processes, and thus can be co-generic. An initial slope failure is thought to transform into a debris flow that deforms frontal sediments, partly disintegrates and dilutes into a turbidity flow. Turbidites are by far the most frequent MMD type in the lake center. They occur throughout the record in all pelagic sedimentary facies, but they are thinner in facies formed during cold climate conditions. All other MMDs, by contrast, incise exclusively the pelagic facies deposited during warm climates. In the 123 m thick Quaternary composite sediment record 230 mass movement events are identified, comprising 33% of the sediment length. Turbidites contribute 93% of the number of Quaternary MMDs, but only 35% of their thickness. In the Pliocene sediments between 123 and 320 m, 181 additional mass movement deposits are identified, which constitute 33% of the recovered sediments. The mean recurrence interval for MMDs is 11 and 5 ka in the Quaternary and Pliocene, respectively.  Author(s) 2013." ;

Hemlock declined throughout its range, apparently due to insect/pathogen outbreaks, which may have been affected by regional climatic shifts. Modern analogues were used to reconstruct submillennial climatic trends from fossil pollen sites spanning the western range limit of hemlock. Reconstructions from eight sites inside the range of hemlock at the time of the decline (5400 cal. yr BP) are compared with eight sites outside the range, which should be independent of variation in hemlock pollen percentages and the non-climatic effects of insects/pathogens. Expansion of hemlock before the decline occurred at a time of increasing precipitation and January temperature. Long-term precipitation averages stabilized at ~5500 cal. yr BP and remained fairly constant throughout the period of low hemlock abundance. January temperature reconstructions decrease at the time of the hemlock decline to approximately modern values at sites inside the range, as well as at oak dominated sites just outside the range. The lower-than-modern precipitation of the mid-Holocene may have reduced hemlock's tolerance for cold stress and winter desiccation and perhaps increased its susceptibility to insects or pathogens. January temperature reconstructions for pine-dominated sites outside the pre-decline hem lock range show little change, possibly due to the insensitivity of pine-dominated pollen assemblages to small climatic fluctuations. Hemlock began a new expansion across the region after 4000 cal. yr BP as July tempera ture decreased and precipitation increased." ;

Although road salt is applied to increase driving safety, this practice influences environmental water quality. Thirteen lakes in the TCMA were studied over 46 months to determine if and how they respond to the seasonal applications of road salt. Sodium and chloride concentrations in these lakes were 10 and 25 times higher, respectively, than in other non-urban lakes in the region. Seasonal salinity/chloride cycles in the lakes were correlated with road salt applications: High concentrations in the winter and spring, especially near the bottom of the lakes, were followed by lower concentrations in the summer and fall due to flushing of the lakes by rainfall runoff. The seasonal salt storage/flushing rates for individual lakes were derived from volume-weighted average chloride concentration time series. The rate ranged from 9 to 55% of a lake's minimum salt content. In some of the lakes studied salt concentrations were high enough to stop spring turnover preventing oxygen from reaching the benthic sediments. Concentrations above the sediments were also high enough to induce convective mixing of the saline water into the sediment pore water. A regional analysis of historical water quality records of 38 lakes in the TCMA showed increases in lake salinity from 1984 to 2005 that were highly correlated with the amount of rock salt purchased by the State of Minnesota. Chloride concentrations in individual lakes were positively correlated with the percent of impervious surfaces in the watershed and inversely with lake volume. Taken together, the results show a continuing degradation of the water quality of urban lakes due to application of NaCl in their watersheds." ;

One of the most challenging problems concerns the character of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in peat porewaters, particularly higher-molecular weight compounds that may function either as non-reactive sinks or reactive intermediates for organic byproducts of microbial decay. The complexity of these large molecules has defied attempts to characterize their molecular structure in bulk samples with a high degree of precision. We therefore determined the composition and reactivity of DOM from representative bog and fen sites in the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands (GLAP) in northern Minnesota, USA. We applied four complementary techniques: electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR MS), proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR), specific UV absorbance (SUVA) and excitationemission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. We observed that the vast majority (>80%) of molecular formulas that appear in the surface bog DOM are also present at 2.9 m depth, indicating that much of DOM in the bog is resistant to microbial degradation. In contrast to bog samples, a considerable number of new compounds with low O/C and high H/C elemental ratios were observed in the 3 m fen horizon relative to surface samples. These results indicate a more pronounced difference in the composition of surface and deep DOM in the fen. SUVA, determined at 254 nm, indicated significantly lower aromaticity in deep fen samples relative to deep bog samples. This trend was verified by 1H NMR. Aromatic and carbohydrate components represented up to 70% of deep bog DOM but comprised a much smaller proportion of deep fen DOM, which was dominated by functionalized and non-functionalized aliphatics. Molecular formula data determined by FT-ICR mass spectrometry were consistent with results from optical and NMR spectroscopy measurements and showed that compounds with low O/C and high H/C were generated with depth in the fen. Such compounds were absent in both surface fen and in surface and deep bog samples respectively, providing further evidence of qualitative and quantitative differences in the evolution of DOM in fens and bogs. These differences, attributed to either variations in source vegetation or environmental factors that render DOM more reactive in fen sites or less reactive in bog sites, have important implications for the response of peatlands to climate change, since climatic change leading to moister conditions may enhance the abundance of sedge-dominated fens and increase the pool of more labile soil carbon." ;

This sequence is of particular importance as it constitutes a high resolution record of late Holocene climatic and environmental change in west-central Mexico. The analyses attainied in this study allowed to recognize abrupt changes, to identify dry periods, and to compare these variations with available records in central Mexico. Laminations are caused in general by alternations of their main components: lithogenic detritus, biogenic and authigenic carbonates, and amorphous material from biological and volcanic remains. The volcaniclastic accumulations include two tephras, one of them, the Toba Jala, produced by the Ceboruco volcano. Six facies of sill, sand and peat were recognized. Horizons characterized by high inorganic carbon content, authigenic siderite, and the dissolution of the finest ferrimagnetic mineralogy (magnetite) in reductive conditions, are upward followed by an increase in the concentrations of fine grained ferrimagnetic minerals. This sequence represents dissolution-precipitation cycles of magnetic minerals by anoxic/oxic variations in the water-sediment interface during warmer and dryer periods. These environmental conditions are especially present around 600-1140 A.D., and 1410-1830 A.D., which coincide with the archeological Classic period (300-900 A.D.) drought, the Little Ice Age (1350-1800 A.D.) and the droughts of the last 700 years. The effects of climatic variations such as the drought occurred in the archeological Classic period, the Medieval Warm, Period, the Litte Ice Age, and the droughts over the last 700 years, have been documented in sites along central Mexico." ;

Few studies, however, have explicitly examined the history of water levels in the Rocky Mountains during the Holocene. Here, we examine the past levels of three lakes near the Continental Divide in Montana and Colorado to reconstruct Holocene moisture trends. Using transects of sediment cores and sub-surface geophysical profiles from each lake, we find that mid-Holocene shorelines in the small lakes (4-110 ha) were as much as 10 m below the modern lake surfaces. Our results are consistent with existing evidence from other lakes and show that a wide range of settings in the region were much drier than today before 3000-2000 years ago. We also discuss evidence for millennial-scale moisture variation, including an abruptly-initiated and -terminated wet period in Colorado from 4400 to 3700 cal yr BP, and find only limited evidence for low-lake stands during the past millennium. The extent of low-water levels during the mid-Holocene, which were most severe and widespread ca 7000-4500 cal yr BP, is consistent with the extent of insolation-induced aridity in previously published regional climate model simulations. Like the simulations, the lake data provide no evidence for enhanced zonal flow during the mid-Holocene, which has been invoked to explain enhanced mid-continent aridity at the time. The data, including widespread evidence for large changes on orbital time scales and for more limited changes during the last millennium, confirm the ability of large boundary-condition changes to push western water supplies beyond the range of recent natural variability.  2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We synthesize the available, published paleolimnological information based on sediment core analyses from three Spanish karstic lakes: Taravilla in the Iberian Range (Guadalajara province), Estanya in the Pre-Prepirinean Range (Huesca province) and Zonar in the Guadalquivir Basin (Cordoba province). The time span ranges from the last 21000 years in Estanya, about 4000 years in Zonar and 2000 years in Taravilla. The multidisciplinary study shows large depositional changes in the lakes mostly related to water level and hydrochemical fluctuations and changes in the watershed. Climate change has been the main forcing to explain the hydrological changes in the lakes. Human impact in the watershed and the lakes has been documented since Iberian-Roman times and it has increased since the Medieval Ages with a much higher sediment delivery to the lakes. Lake sediment sequences contain detailed archives of global changes in the past, needed to understand the natural climate variability and the dynamics of the lacustrine systems. These data will help to implement conservation and restoration policies of aquatic ecosystems and also strategies for adaptation to future climate changes." ;

Recently, increasing concern about human manipulation of global nutrient cycles has required a long-term approach to assessing the nutrient status of aquatic systems. Data available in palaeorecords can assess current trophic status, baseline conditions, and long-term processes controlling nutrient fluxes on decadal to millennial timescales. Here, we review three palaeolimnological methods used to reconstruct nutrient cycling: (1) chemical compounds preserved in lacustrine sediment, (2) aquatic biotic indicators (often using a quantitative transfer function), and (3) quantitative empirical sediment flux estimates. The millennial-scale regulation of nutrient cycling by climate and catchment geochemistry leads to a gradual trajectory of dystrophication over the Holocene in many temperate lakes. In many systems, the magnitude of recent anthropogenic changes to nutrient cycling is large compared with natural fluctuations, but this perspective could also be due to the selection of study sites that are currently experiencing eutrophication. Increased nutrient loading to aquatic systems is not always accompanied by decreased ecosystem function. The powerful temporal perspective from palaeolimnology can be complemented with modern mechanistic approaches to lead to increased understanding of the rates, patterns, and mechanisms of nutrient fluxes." ;

The better dated of these two serial pollen records (Searles Lake) served as a reference section for improving the effective radiometric age control in a nearby and more complete pollen record (Owens Lake) because they: (1) are situated ~ 90 km apart in the same drainage system (on, and immediately leeward of, the eastern flank of the Sierra Nevada), and (2) preserved strikingly similar pollen profiles and concordant sequences of sedimentological changes. Pollen assemblages from both lakes are well preserved and diverse, and document serial changes in Late Pleistocene and Holocene plant zone distribution and composition in the westernmost Great Basin; they consist of taxa now inhabiting montane forest, woodland, steppe, and desert-scrub environments. The studied core intervals are interpreted here to be the terrestrial equivalent of marine 18O stages 1 through 9; these pollen profiles now appear to be among the best radiometrically dated Late Pleistocene records of terrestrial climate change known." ;

(1) El Nino-Southern Oscillation variability, while the most important global-scale mode of interannual climate variation, is insufficient to explain most of the variation of tropical South American climate observed in both the instrumental and the paleoclimate records. (2) Significant climate variation in tropical South America occurs on seasonal to orbital (i.e. multi-millennial) time scales as a result of sea-surface temperature (SST) variation and oceanatmosphere interactions of the tropical Atlantic. (3) Decadal-scale climate variability, linked with this tropical Atlantic variability, has been a persistent characteristic of climate in tropical South America for at least the past half millennium, and likely, far beyond. (4) Centennial-to-millennial climate events in tropical South America were of longer duration and, perhaps, larger amplitude than any observed in the instrumental period, which is little more than a century long in tropical South America. These were superimposed upon both precession-paced insolation changes that caused significant variation in SASM precipitation and eccentricity-paced global glacial boundary conditions that caused significant changes in the tropical South American moisture balance. As a result, river sediment and water discharge increased and decreased across tropical South America, lake levels rose and fell, paleolakes arose and disappeared on the Altiplano, glaciers waxed and waned in the tropical Andes, and the tropical rainforest underwent significant changes in composition and extent. To further evaluate climate forcing over the last glacial cycle (125 ka), we developed a climate forcing model that combines summer insolation forcing and a proxy for North Atlantic SST forcing to reconstruct long-term precipitation variation in the SASM domain. The success of this model reinforces our confidence in assigning causation to observed reconstructions of precipitation. In addition, we propose a critical correction for speleothem stable oxygen isotopic ratios, which are among the most significant of paleoclimate proxies in tropical South America for reconstruction of variation of paleo-precipitation (or SASM intensity). However, it is already well known that any particular 18O value observed in speleothem carbonate is affected by two processes that have nothing to do with changes in precipitation amountthe influence of temperature on carbonate-water isotopic fractionation in the cave and the influence of changing 18O of seawater. Quantitatively accounting for both artifacts can significantly alter the interpretations of speleothem records. In tropical South America, both adjustments act in the same direction and have the tendency to increase the true amplitude of the paleo-hydrologic signal (but by different amounts in glacial and inter-glacial stages). These corrections have even graver implications for the interpretation of tropical Northern Hemisphere speleothem records (e.g. Chinese speleothems) where the combined adjustments tend to decrease or even eliminate the true signal amplitude." ;

The preliminary multidisciplinary study carried out so far include pollen and sedimentological analyses, comprising geochemical, X ray fluorescence (XRF), mineralogical, organic and inorganic content (TOC/TIC) analyses. The chronological model has been established combining AMS 14C on the first 20 m of sediment and OSL methods on the remaining 54 m to the bottom. The sedimentary sequence is essentially formed by alternating facies of peatbogs and wetlands with those of distal alluvial fan deposits and others of carbonate lake. The results currently obtained support relatively humid conditions at El Canizar de Villarquemado during a likely MIS6-MIS5 period, as errors linked to the age model prevent us to guarantee precisely the period boundaries. Despite indications of humidity, the regional vegetation variations during the MIS6-MIS5 period, essentially represented by Juniperus, were constrained by the intense continentality of the area, resulting in unexpected pollen assemblages for an interglacial period as the Eemian. The most arid phase of the sequence is registered during the MIS3, as shown by the available sedimentological and palynological results, while the MIS2 presents greater local and regional variability as proved by the sedimentary facies and aquatics and the other pollen spectra, respectively. The Holocene presents an abrupt onset regarding palaeohydrology while terrestrial vegetation, dominated by pine instead than Juniperus as in the sequence's bottom, show a resilient response as these are well adapted communities to extreme continentality. The later development of both, evergreen and marcescent Quercus, together with the presence of pine woodland, indicate very different climatic conditions between the MIS5 and MIS1 interglacial periods.

Early Holocene summers at the study site were characterized by more thermophilous assemblages and warmer inferred temperatures than today, presumably in response to the positive anomaly in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. Peak early Holocene warmth was interrupted by two cold reversals between 9.5 and 8 cal ka BP, during which multiple cold-stenothermous chironomid taxa appeared in the lake. The earlier reversal appears to correlate with widespread climate anomalies around 9.2 cal ka BP; the age of the younger reversal is equivocal but it may correlate with the 8.2 cal ka BP cold event documented elsewhere. Widespread, abrupt climate shifts in the early Holocene illustrate the susceptibility of the climate system to perturbations, even during periods of enhanced warmth in the Northern Hemisphere.  2008 University of Washington." ;

The valleys that contain these lakes have similar bedrock compositions and hypsometries, but have different headwall elevations and aspects, which makes them useful for investigating the magnitude of past glaciations. There was widespread glacial retreat in the Venezuelan Andes during the early Holocene, after which most watersheds remained ice free, and thus far only valleys with headwalls higher than ~4400masl contain evidence of glaciation during the last ~10ka. There was a pronounced shift in sediment composition for the Montos (headwall: ~4750masl) and Los Anteojos (headwall: ~4400masl) records during the middle Holocene from ~8.0 to 7.7ka when conditions appear to have become ice free and drier. There is tentative evidence that the glacier in the Mucubaji valley (headwall: ~4609masl) advanced from ~8.1 to 6.6ka and then retreated during the latter stages of the middle Holocene. Clastic sediment accumulation in other nearby lake basins was either low or decreased throughout most of the middle Holocene as watersheds stabilized under warmer and/or drier conditions. In the Montos record, there was another major shift in sediment composition that occurred from ~6.5 to 5.7ka, similar to other regional records that suggest conditions were drier during this period. Overall, the late Holocene was a period of warmer and wetter conditions with ice extent at a minimum in the northern tropical Andes. There were also punctuated decadal to multi-centennial periods of higher clastic sediment accumulation during the last ~4ka, likely in response to periods of cooling and/or local precipitation changes. In watersheds with headwalls above 4600masl, there is evidence of glacial advances during the Little Ice Age (~0.6-0.1ka). The pattern of glacial variability is generally similar in both the northern and southern tropics during the Little Ice Age, suggesting that ice margins in both regions were responding to colder and wetter conditions during the latest Holocene. The observed pattern of Holocene climate variability in the Venezuelan Andes cannot be explained by insolation forcing alone, and tropical ocean influences were likely associated with the observed glacial and lake level changes.  2014 Elsevier Ltd." ;

Varved sediments from Elk Lake, Clearwater County, Minnesota, are among the best studied in terms of paleoenvironmental proxies, yet the sedimentary architecture of those sediments has not been previously studied and the hydrological responses of the lake - changes in level and volume - are poorly known. High-resolution seismic-reflection (CHIRP) profiles of Elk Lake reveal complex sedimentary basins in the lake, a pattern of nearshore onlap of sediments onto older substrates, and the focusing of sediments into several deep basins. Biogenic gas obscures sediments in the deepest parts of the basins, but beneath the rest of the lake, a three-part Holocene sequence is clear. The transitions between these parts are correlated with lithological changes defined in earlier core studies. Sediments of the modern stage are less focused than those of the prairie lake stage. A prominent erosional unconformity occurs within the Holocene sequence, separating sediments from the prairie and modern stages of the lake. Erosion associated with this unconformity extends to a depth of 18.2 m below the modern water surface, at which point the unconformity grades into a conformable horizon within the sequence in the deep basins of the lake. This transition is an analog of the onlap of modern sediments onto older substrates, which occurs at a depth of about 8.2 m. The configuration of the erosional unconformity and its modern analog indicates a lake-level fall in the mid Holocene of 10.0 m. At its mid-Holocene minimum, the lake was 39% of its present size and 30% of its present volume, providing quantitative evidence to aid in constraining and evaluating reconstructions of mid-Holocene aridity in the mid-continent of North America.

However, neither the climatic driver nor the seasonal character of precipitation during this period is well understood because of the limitations of available proxy indicators. For example, an important challenge is to distinguish among the interacting effects of evaporation, temperature, or precipitation seasonality in existing 18O records from the region. Here we combine hydrogen isotopes of palmitic acid and oxygen isotopes of carbonate to derive lake-water isotopic values during the Holocene at Steel Lake in north-central Minnesota. In combination, these data enable us to separate variations in evaporation from variations in the isotopic composition of input-waters to lake. Variations in evaporation are used as a proxy for aridity and lake-water input isotopic values are used as a proxy for the isotopic values of meteoric precipitation. Our results suggest that lake-water input isotopic values were more negative during the middle Holocene than at present. To test whether these more negative values are related to temperature or precipitation seasonality, we compare pollen-inferred temperatures and the expected isotopic value of precipitation resulting from these temperatures to the reconstructed precipitation isotopic values. Results suggest that middle Holocene warmth and aridity were associated with increased evaporation rates and decreased summer precipitation. These inferences are consistent with climate simulations that highlight the role of seasonal insolation and sea surface temperatures in driving variations in precipitation seasonality during the Holocene. Results also suggest that changes in Holocene precipitation seasonality may have influenced the expansion of the prairie-forest border in Minnesota as well as regional variations in grassland community composition. This study demonstrates the efficacy of the dual hydrogen and oxygen isotope approach for distinguishing changes in evaporation and precipitation seasonality in the paleolimnological record.  2010 Elsevier B.V." ;

The following synthesis of Lake Bonneville history is based on a critical evaluation of the stratigraphic and geomorphic contexts of 83 radiocarbon ages of a variety of samples, including wood, charcoal, dispersed organic matter, mollusk shells, and tufa. The lake began to rise from levels close to average Holocene levels after about 28 ka. By 22 ka it had transgressed approximately 100 m; between 22 and 20 ka it regressed about 45 m in the Stansbury oscillation and the Stansbury shoreline was formed. Transgression after 20 ka proceeded in two phases--a rapid phase from 20 to 18 ka, and a slower phase from 18 to 15 ka. The lake overflowed intermittently at its highest level (the Bonneville shoreline) from about 15 to 14.5 ka, then catastrophically dropped 100 m during the Bonneville Flood to the level of the Provo shoreline, which it occupied until about 14 ka. Subsequent closed-basin regression was rapid and complete by 12 ka, and was followed by a modest transgression to form the Gilbert shoreline between 10.9 and 10.3 ka. The Lake Bonneville record is an accurate proxy of the changing water balance in the Bonneville basin during the late Pleistocene, although the nature of the climatic changes during this period are still uncertain." ;

These interpretations are largely based on experimental studies that indicate that microbial sulfate reduction is accompanied by a substantial kinetic isotope effect (up to 66), but only at sulfate concentrations >200 M. In this study, we examine S isotope systematics in a modern, low-sulfate euxinic lake (100350 M) and find that the calculated kinetic isotope effect associated with microbial sulfate reduction (34S) is relatively large (23.5), but preserved 34S values are considerably smaller (4.79.9). 34S values in this system are controlled by the fraction of the sulfate reservoir that is consumed during sulfate reduction and the location of pyrite formation. This reservoir effect strongly influences the S isotope composition of sulfide preserved in the rock record such that 34S values increase as a function of sulfate levels, even when sulfate concentrations are >200 M and the kinetic isotope effect is expressed. These findings have important implications for reconstructing the chemical evolution of the ocean-atmosphere system throughout Earth historynot just for the Precambrian." ;

In peatlands, biota significantly alters surficial acidbase equilibrium and solute chemistry by releasing dissolved organic compounds into surface and pore waters, which then mix through advection and dispersion through pore water flow paths. We report herein the results of new geochemical mixing models that incorporates organic acid dissociation constants to understand how organic acids control the acidbase chemistry in mixtures of dilute acidic bog pore waters and circum-neutral groundwater (typical of carbonate terrains) that upwells or disperses into peat deposits. In our new mixing models, at least twice as much groundwater is required to neutralize bog water acidity when dissolved organic carbon concentrations exceed 10 mmol/L than in their absence. Although it remains uncertain how future climatic change will alter the composition of dissolved organic matter in peatlands, organic acids should remain an important factor with respect to potential neutralization of peatland waters by groundwater sources. The acid base equilibria in large peat basins not only has important implications for vegetation patterning but also for biogeochemical cycles in these globally important reservoirs for carbon." ;

Lake level fluctuations in these sedimentary records are frequently associated with climatic changes. However, in active volcanic and tectonic settings, lacustrine sedimentation may be altered by these processes by affecting the place of deposition and controlling the volume and type of detrital material available for removal by surface processes. In consequence, it is necessary to analyze volcanic and tectonic processes in order to achieve a better understanding of climatic and environmental changes in the lacustrine sedimentary sequences in this type of environment. Additionally, volcanic material preserved in lacustrine sequences document the recurrence of volcanic activity in a region. Lake Chalco basin, located in the central part of the Transmexican Volcanic Belt, offers an ideal site to evaluate the impact of volcanic and tectonic activity on lacustrine sedimentation. In this work, we analyze the uppermost 26.7 m of the lacustrine sequence collected in seven cores drilled in different parts of Lake Chalco. In the obtained sequences, we determined the sedimentary facies succession, established their lateral distribution, and analyzed the sedimentary architecture and the impact of volcanotectonic activity on the lacustrine system. The time scale was constructed from radiocarbon determinations and well dated marker tephras from the region. The composite sequence spans the last ca.60000 yr B.P. (MIS 3-MIS 1). Thirteen facies were recognized and grouped into three main categories: 1) detritic, 2) volcaniclastic, and 3) biogenic. Volcaniclastic deposits comprise 18 individual layers 1-50 cm thick, two of which are from well documented eruptions from Popocat&#233;petl and Nevado de Toluca volcanoes. From our cores and other available information, we suggest that the monogenetic volcano Teuhtli, in the southwestern part of the Chalco lacustrine plain, is the origin of the so called Gran Ceniza Bas&#225;ltica tephra, dated between ca. 27000 y 41000 cal B.P. The accumulation of Teuhtli derived products altered the basin morphology and affected the lacustrine sedimentation, which is observed in the diatom record. We suggest that an ancient depocentre was located south of the modern lake, and that its location was controlled by synsedimentary normal faulting, active until ca. 26500 years ago." ;

New and previously published results were stratified by elevation into upper and lower and tree line to explore the role of Holocene climate variability on vegetation dynamics and fire regimes. During the cooler and drier Lateglacial period, ca 13,000 cal yr BP, sparsely vegetated Picea parkland occupied Foy Lake as well as other low- and high-elevations with a low incidence of fire. During the warmer early Holocene, from ca 11,000-7500 cal yr BP, low-elevation records, including Foy, indicate significant restructuring of regional vegetation as Lateglacial Picea parkland gave way to a mixed forest of Pinus-Pseudotsuga-Larix. In contrast, upper tree line sites (ca >2000 m) supported Pinus albicaulis and/or P. monticola-Abies-Picea forests in the Lateglacial and early Holocene. Regionally, biomass burning gradually increased from the Lateglacial times through the middle Holocene. However, upper tree line fire-history records suggest several climate-driven decreases in biomass burning centered at 11,500, 8500, 4000, 1600 and 500 cal yr BP. In contrast, lower tree line records generally experienced a gradual increase in biomass burning from the Lateglacial to ca 8000 cal yr BP, then reduced fire activity until a late Holocene maximum at 1800 cal yr BP, as structurally complex mesophytic forests at Foy Lake and other sites supported mixed-severity fire regimes. During the last two millennia, fire activity decreased at low elevations as modern forests developed and the climate became cooler and wetter than before. Embedded within these long-term trends are high amplitude variations in both vegetation dynamics and biomass burning. High-elevation paleoecological reconstructions tend to be more responsive to long-term changes in climate forcing related to growing-season temperature. Low-elevation records in the NRM have responded more abruptly to changes in effective precipitation during the late Holocene. Prolonged droughts, including those between 1200 and 800 cal yr BP, and climatic cooling during the last few centuries continues to influence vegetation and fire regimes at low elevation while increasing temperature has increased biomass burning in high elevations." ;

Cumbres Bog is unusually deep (basal sediments extend 12 m below the surface) for its altitude (~3050 m a.s.l.) and we extracted 7 m core of continuous sediment below ~5 m of water and peat. The resulting record provides strong evidence of: a period of warming immediately after the LGM (~1813 cal. kyr BP), a cool interval coinciding with the Younger Dryas (~12.811.5 cal. kyr BP), a warm stable period from 10 to 6 cal. kyr BP, and a cooler and highly variable climate interval after 6 cal. kyr BP. More specifically, pollen ratios and fossil diatoms indicate that cold periods generally match with previously identified periods of rapid climate change that occurred at 10.6, 8.77.9, 7.06.9, 5.45.2, 3.33.0, 2.3, 2.0 and 1.5 cal. kyr BP. This record also adds resolution to previous regional records and indicates that the periodicity of climate variability changed from 20003000 years to 7001100 years around 6 cal. kyr BP and to <500 years after 3.5 cal. kyr BP. Overall, our record provides important, relatively high-resolution paleoclimatic information for this remote region of the southern Rockies." ;

Two major determinants of circum-African climate variability over this time period are supported by principal components analysis: North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) variations and local insolation maxima. North Atlantic SSTs correlated with the variability found in most circum-African SST records, whereas the variability of the majority of terrestrial temperature and precipitation records is explained by local insolation maxima, particularly at times when solar radiation was intense and highly variable (e.g., 150-75 ka). We demonstrate that climates varied with latitude, such that periods of relatively increased aridity or humidity were asynchronous across the northern, eastern, tropical and southern portions of Africa. Comparisons of the archaeological, fossil, or genetic records with generalized patterns of environmental change based solely on northern hemisphere glacial/interglacial cycles are therefore imprecise. We compare our refined climatic framework to a database of 64 radiometrically-dated paleoanthropological sites to test hypotheses of demographic response to climatic change among African hominin populations during the 150-30 ka interval. We argue that at a continental scale, population and climate changes were asynchronous and likely occurred under different regimes of climate forcing, creating alternating opportunities for migration into adjacent regions. Our results suggest little relation between large scale demographic and climate change in southern Africa during this time span, but strongly support the hypothesis of hominin occupation of the Sahara during discrete humid intervals ~135-115 ka and 105-75 ka. Hominin populations in equatorial and eastern Africa may have been buffered from the extremes of climate change by locally steep altitudinal and rainfall gradients and the complex and variable effects of increased aridity on human habitat suitability in the tropics. Our data are consistent with hominin migrations out of Africa through varying exit points from ~140-80 ka." ;

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning X-ray fluorescence (XRF) techniques are fast, cost effective, efficient methods to determine the relative abundances of these components. We investigate the potential of these techniques using sediments from two large lakes, Lake Malawi in Africa and Lake Qinghai in China. Our results show statistically significant correlations of conventionally measured concentrations of carbonate (%CaCO3), total organic carbon (%TOC), and biogenic silica (%BSi), with absorbance in the corresponding FTIR spectral regions and with XRF elemental ratios including calcium:titanium (Ca/Ti), incoherent:coherent X-ray scatter intensities (Inc/Coh), and silicon:titanium (Si/Ti), respectively. The correlation coefficients (R) range from 0.66 to 0.96 for comparisons of FTIR results and conventional measurements, and from 0.70 to 0.90 for XRF results and conventional measurements. Both FTIR and XRF techniques exhibit great potential for rapid assessment of inorganic and organic contents of lacustrine sediments. However, the relationship between XRF-ratios or FTIR-absorbances and abundances of corresponding sedimentary components can vary with sediment source and lithology.  2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht." ;

Prior to 11,500 cal yr BP, cool conditions dominated, fire activity was low, and alpine tundra and Picea parkland grew on the landscape. A step-like climate change to warm summer conditions occurred at 11,500 cal yr BP. In response, fire activity increased facilitating a transition from Picea parkland to closed Pinus forest. From 11,500 to 8280 cal yr BP, warm summers and abundant moisture mostly likely from high winter snowfall supported closed Pinus contorta forests. Cooler drier summer conditions prevailed beginning 8280 cal yr BP due to decreased summer insolation and winter snowpack, and lower parkland developed. The timing of vegetation change in the Blacktail Pond record is similar to other low- and middle-elevation sites in the northern Rocky Mountains during the late-glacial period, suggesting local plant communities responded to regional-scale climate change; however, the timing of vegetation changes was spatially variable during the early and middle Holocene due to the varying influences of strengthened summer monsoons and subtropical high on regional precipitation patterns." ;

High-resolution pollen and charcoal analyses were used to examine the impact of Mt Mazama tephra on forest vegetation and possible synergistic interactions with fire activity in the Central Oregon Cascade Range. We selected four small watersheds on a longitudinal transect north of Mt Mazama and recovered lake sediment that spanned the period of tephra deposition. Our sediment records had between 14 and 50 cm of tephra deposited, and we analyzed the sediment at centimeter resolution before and after the deposition horizon in each sediment record. Our analysis shows that nonarboreal pollen percentages and accumulation rates were depressed after Mazama tephra deposition. Recovery to pre-tephra deposition rates occurred after approximately 50100 years. Arboreal pollen percentage and accumulation rates were less severely impacted, suggesting that the Mazama tephra deposition disrupted understory communities more significantly than overstory species, and that forest communities returned to their pre-tephra-deposition conditions after approximately 50100 years. Fire events in conjunction with the Mazama tephra occurred in two of the four sites, suggesting that tephra deposition did not create conditions that precipitated a fire event in a consistent way. This research reinforces the notion that disturbance events may have cumulative effects on forest vegetation, but that the impacts of disturbance events need to be felt by similar constituents of the forest ecosystem to be truly additive." ;

The contrast provides evidence of a multi-centennial moisture dipole across the Southern and Central Rocky Mountains' region similar to one associated with the efects of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on annual to decadal time scales today. Cores and ground penetrating radar (GPR) profles from Emerald Lake show that deep-water muds accumulated as extensively across the lake basin as today at ca. 3.6-3.0 and 1.4-0.8 ka, and nearly as extensively at 2.5-1.9 ka. The extensive muds indicate episodes of high water at Emerald Lake and date to times when Lake of the Woods was low. Nearshore sand layers at Emerald Lake indicate that water levels fell during the intervening centuries, including when bristlecone pine chronologies have documented repeated multi-decadal droughts in the Upper Arkansas River Basin. Water levels were also low, based on the absence of nearshore mud accumulation, before ca. 3.6 ka, and dramatically lower (>2 m in the currently 4.5-m deep lake) before a sharp rise in water levels by ca. 5.7 ka. A basin-wide change in sediment accumulation patterns, consistent with an expansion and deepening of the lake at ca. 5.7 ka, correlates with regional cooling and similar evidence of increased efective moisture at Lake of the Woods and other sites throughout central North America. The step increase in moisture availability may relate to a global-scale reorganization of climatic patterns, which developed as the mid- and high-latitudes cooled in response to a decline in summer insolation." ;

The core also contained 15 tephra layers, which were characterised by electron-microprobe analysis of volcanic glass shards. Identified tephra include Mount St. Helens Ye, 3.69 ka; Mazama ash bed, 7.54 ka; Mount St. Helens layer C, 35-50 ka; an unnamed Mount St. Helens tephra, 75-150 ka; the tephra equivalent of layer E at Pringle Falls, Oregon, <218 ka; and an andesitic tephra layer similar to that at Tulelake, California, 174 ka. Ten calibrated radiocarbon ages and the ages of Mount St. Helens Ye, Mazama ash, and the unnamed Mount St. Helens tephra were used to develop an age-depth model. This model was refined by also incorporating the age of marine oxygen isotope stage (IS) boundary 4/5 (73.9 ka) and the age of IS-5e (125 ka). The justification for this age-model is based on an analysis of the pollen record and lithologic data. The pollen record is divided into 11 assemblage zones that describe alternations between periods of montane conifer forest, pine forest, and steppe. The previous interglacial period (IS-5e) supported temperate xerothermic forests of pine and oak and a northward and westward expansion of steppe and juniper woodland, compared to their present occurrence. The period from 83 to 117 ka contains intervals of pine forest and parkland alternating with pine-spruce forest, suggesting shifts from cold humid to cool temperate conditions. Between 73 and 83 ka, a forest of oak, hemlock, Douglas-fir, and fir was present that has no modern analogue. It suggests warm wet summers and cool wet winters. Cool humid conditions during the mid-Wisconsin interval supported mixed conifer forest with Douglas-fir and spruce. The glacial interval featured cold dry steppe, with an expansion of spruce in the late-glacial. Xerothermic communities prevailed in the early Holocene, when temperate steppe was widespread and the lake dried intermittently. The middle Holocene was characterised by ponderosa pine forest, and the modern vegetation was established in the last 3900 yr, when ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, fir, and oak were part of the local vegetation." ;

In order to assess the impact of changing climate on the terrestrial environment, we generated a record of compound specific  13C from terrestrial leaf waxes, a proxy for ecosystem-level C 3/C 4 plant abundances, and compared the results to previously published pollen-inferred regional vegetation shifts. We observe a general coherence between temperature and rainfall, with a warm, wet interval peaking 10-9 ka and subsequent gradual cooling and drying over the remainder of the Holocene. These results, particularly those of rainfall, are in general agreement with other tropical African climate records, indicating a somewhat consistent view of climate over a wide region of tropical East Africa. The  13C record from Lake Victoria leaf waxes does not appear to reflect changes in regional climate or vegetation. However, palynological analyses document an abrupt shift from a Poaceae (grasses)-dominated ecosystem during the cooler, arid late Pleistocene to a Moraceae-dominated (trees/shrubs) landscape during the warm, wet early Holocene. We theorize that these proxies are reflecting vegetation in different locations around Lake Victoria. Our results suggest a predominantly insolation-forced climate, with warm, wet conditions peaking at the maximum interhemispheric seasonal insolation contrast, likely intensifying monsoonal precipitation, while maximum aridity coincides with the rainy season insolation and the interhemispheric contrast gradient minima. We interpret a shift in conditions at the Younger Dryas to indicate a limited switch in insolation-dominated control on climate of the Lake Victoria region, to remote teleconnections with the coupled Atlantic and Pacific climate system.  2012 Elsevier Ltd." ;

The abundance of siliciclastic sediment indicates that the Bear River usually was connected to Bear Lake. However, three marl intervals containing more than 50% CaCO3 were deposited during the Holocene and the last two interglacial intervals, equivalent to marine oxygen isotope stages (MIS) 5 and 7, indicating times when the Bear River was not connected to the lake. Aragonite is the dominant mineral in two of these three high-carbonate intervals. The high-carbonate, aragonitic intervals coincide with warm interglacial continental climates and warm Pacific sea-surface temperatures. Aragonite also is the dominant mineral in a carbonate-cemented microbialite mound that formed in the southwestern part of the lake over the last several thousand years. The history of carbonate sedimentation in Bear Lake is documented through the study of isotopic ratios of oxygen, carbon, and strontium, organic carbon content, CaCO3 content, X-ray diffraction mineralogy, and HCl-leach chemistry on samples from sediment traps, gravity cores, piston cores, drill cores, and microbialites.Sediment-trap studies show that the carbonate mineral that precipitates in the surface waters of the lake today is high-Mg calcite. The lake began to precipitate high-Mg calcite sometime in the midtwentieth century after the artificial diversion of Bear River into Bear Lake that began in 1911. This diversion drastically reduced the salinity and Mg2+:Ca2+ of the lake water and changed the primary carbonate precipitate from aragonite to high-Mg calcite. However, sediment-trap and core studies show that aragonite is the dominant mineral accumulating on the lake floor today, even though it is not precipitating in surface waters. The isotopic studies show that this aragonite is derived from reworking and redistribution of shallow-water sediment that is at least 50 yr old, and probably older. Apparently, the microbialite mound also stopped forming aragonite cement sometime after Bear River diversion. Because of reworking of old aragonite, the bulk mineralogy of carbonate in bottom sediments has not changed very much since the diversion. However, the diversion is marked by very distinct changes in the chemical and isotopic composition of the bulk carbonate.After the last glacial interval (LGI), a large amount of endogenic carbonate began to precipitate in Bear Lake when the Pacific moisture that filled the large pluvial lakes of the Great Basin during the LGI diminished, and Bear River apparently abandoned Bear Lake. At first, the carbonate that formed was low-Mg calcite, but ~11,000 years ago, salinity and Mg2+:Ca2+ thresholds must have been crossed because the amount of aragonite gradually increased. Aragonite is the dominant carbonate mineral that has accumulated in the lake for the past 7000 years, with the addition of high-Mg calcite after the diversion of Bear River into the lake at the beginning of the twentieth century." ;

We calibrated charcoal accumulation in sediments from three medium (14-19 ha) and one large (4250 ha) lake with a 300 yr tree-ring-based fire-history reconstruction from central Yellowstone National Park (YNP) to reconstruct local fire occurrence and area burned within a 128 840 ha study area. Charcoal peaks most accurately reflected fires within 1.2-3.0 km of coring sites, whereas total charcoal accumulation correlated best with area burned within 6.0-51 km (r(2)=0.22-0.62, p<0.05). To reconstruct area burned for the entire study area, we developed a statistical model based on a composite charcoal record. The model explained 64-79% of the variability in area burned from ad 1675 to 1960 and was robust to cross-validation. Reconstructed area burned from ad 1240-1975 was significantly higher during periods including extreme annual drought (p=0.05), and area burned varied significantly at approximate to 60 yr timescales (p<0.05), similar to the variability in an independent precipitation reconstruction covering the same period. Widespread burning (>10 000 ha) occurred at 150-300 yr intervals, and at the site level, fire probability increased with stand age (composite Weibull c parameter = 1.61 [95% CI 1.36-2.54]), both suggesting that post-fire stand development played an important intermediary role between climate and fire by increasing fuel abundance and probability of fire spread. Our study illustrates the possibility of reconstructing area burned with multiple charcoal records, and results imply that future fire regimes in YNP will be governed by direct impacts of altered moisture regimes and by vegetation dynamics affecting the abundance and continuity of fuels." ;

These genotypes were resurrected from preserved resting eggs isolated from sediments belonging to three time periods: 2002-2008, 1967-1977, and 1301-1646 A.D. Toxicity of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos was determined through a series of acute toxicity tests. There was a significant dose-response effect in all genotypes studied. Moreover, significant variation in toxicity among genotypes within each time period was detected. Importantly, a significant effect of time period on sensitivity to chlorpyrifos was found. Analysis of the median effect concentrations (EC50s) for genotypes within each time period indicated that the 1301-1646 genotypes were 2.7 times more sensitive than the 1967-1977 genotypes. This trend may be partially explained by microevolutionary shifts in response to cultural eutrophication." ;

Highly organic, diatomaceous muds provide evidence for shifts in wind intensity and stratification within an early Holocene wet phase. Lake level variations within this period may have shifted due to tectonic lowering of the lake's outlet level. The onset of mid-Holocene aridity, as documented by the appearance of authigenic calcite at 5200 cal yr BP, initiated a period of falling lake levels that culminated in a late Holocene lowstand between 4000 and 2000 cal yr BP. This lowstand is documented by coarse sediments whose fabric and mineralogy depend on the core site. Although different cores yield different ages for this regression, it appears that declining lake levels culminated in a maximum lake lowstand of -14 m. Lake levels then rose rapidly, attaining modern positions by 1700 cal yr BP. This lake level history suggests that although many paleoclimatic changes in Africa are apparently synchronous throughout northern hemispheric Africa, other events may be spatially heterogeneous. These patterns highlight the need for a well-dated network of paleoclimate sites within the African continent.  2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved." ;

Location: Hawai'i Experimental Tropical Forest (HETF), a tropical montane wet forest, on Mauna Kea, Hawai'i Island, Hawai'i, USA. Methods: Previous studies employing airborne LiDAR were used to define three zones across an elevation gradient from 900 to 1500 m. Within each zone, a ~1000-m block transect was selected to cross two different volcanic substrates: one derived from surface lava and one derived from thick ash deposits. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) scores of vegetation data were related to independently-derived environmental NMS scores and spatial location with generalized additive models (GAM). Results: Vascular plant species composition in all elevation zones consists of three NMS axes, which are best modelled by one of three possible environmental NMS axes or by location. The first NMS axis of species composition in the lowest elevation zone (40% variance explained (VE)) is a function of location on volcanic substrates (61% deviance explained (DE)). The second lowest elevation axis (27% VE) is a function of unexplained spatial heterogeneity (31% DE). The third lowest elevation NMS axis (24% VE) is a function of the spatial mosaic of canopy disturbance (16% DE). In the middle elevation zone, species composition most strongly relates to the interaction between volcanic substrate and the condition of the soil surface for all three NMS axes (41%, 27%, 24% VE; 70%, 16%, 24% DE). The primary axis of species composition in the highest elevation zone (41% VE) corresponds with substrate and soil condition (55% DE) but the second and third axes of species composition (27% and 25% VE) relate to canopy dieback disturbance (36%, 14% DE). Counts of exotic species and 0-2 m height class native tree species respond to the type of volcanic substrate and soil surface condition in all three elevation zones. Lava-derived substrates have a higher incidence of exotic species and less native tree regeneration; whereas ash-derived substrates have higher numbers of native tree species regenerating and many fewer exotic species. Discussion: The tropical montane forests on Mauna Kea reflect a native-dominated plant community response to disturbance on both lava- and ash-derived volcanic substrates, and a higher propensity for exotic species to occur on the lava-derived substrate. Native plant communities on ash-derived soils may have higher resilience to exotic invasion than communities on lava-derived substrates. Our results indicate resource managers should explicitly account for variation in soils and substrate type when prioritizing, implementing and monitoring management interventions to foster native plant assemblages and control the spread of exotic and invasive species.  2013 International Association for Vegetation Science." ;

Chronologic control for Indian Cove is provided by the Lava Creek B (0.60 Ma), Bishop (0.76 Ma), and Huckleberry Ridge (2.06 Ma) volcanic ashes. The processing of close-interval (3 m, ca. 8 ka) samples is complete for the upper 628 m (1.5 Ma) of the Indian Cove well. During the last 750 ka, interglacial-glacial cycles are expressed as the ratio of Juniperus + Ambrosia + Sarcobatus (interglacial) vs. Picea, Abies, and Pseudotsuga (glacial). Correlating the peak abundances of this ratio with the odd-numbered oxygen isotope stages has refined the time control provided by three volcanic tephra. The average Pleistocene sedimentation rate is 0.39 m ka-1 (Huckleberry Ridge, 2057 ka, 797 m). Based on the refined time scale, resulting from correlation with the marine chronology, sedimentation reached maximum values during isotope stages 11-9, and was slow between stages 13 and 11 and stages 9-7. Development of the Bonneville Pluvial cycles, from 759 to 600 ka, is recorded by changes in wetland and aquatic palynomorphs. Increased pollen concentration above 150 m (310 ka) may result from the diversion of the Bear River into the Great Salt Lake Basin." ;

Evident in the sediment are several slumps, debris flows, or landslides, which are confirmed by 14C dating. Removal of these facies produces a continuous sedimentary sequence for the past 13,000 yr with exception of one ~260-yr hiatus associated with a 1.5-m-thick slump deposit. All ages except one are on terrestrial macrofossils and charcoal. A test age on aquatic organic detritus shows a hardwater effect of 600 yr at ~2000 cal BP. Two ages from the same level on herbaceous charcoal and Chenopodium seeds are statistically the same, which further demonstrates the suitability of charcoal from grassland environments for AMS 14C age control. However, 2 specimens of wood charcoal are too old relative to bracketing ages and glacial geologic history. These ages confirm the sedimentary interpretation of redeposition and provide a caution about the longevity of wood charcoal in the environment and its suitability for age control in lacustrine sediments.  2011 by the Arizona Board of Regents on behalf of the University of Arizona." ;

The magnitude of the 18O depletion and the complete lack of any rhyolites with normal values (710) combine to suggest that assimilation or melting of a caldera block altered by near- contemporaneous hydrothermal activity is unlikely. Instead, we envisage generation of the high-temperature rhyolites by shallow melting of Idaho Batholith rocks, under the influence of the Yellowstone hotspot, affected by Eocene meteoric-hydrothermal events. The seeming worldwide scarcity of strongly 18O-depleted rhyolites may simply reflect a similar scarcity of suitable crustal protoliths." ;

A groundwater flow-through lake in west-central Montana (USA) registers latest Pleistocene and Holocene hydroclimatic variation in fluid and solute balance, as controlled by rates and timing of groundwater recharge. Early Holocene warming occurred under conditions of relative aridity and low groundwater throughflow, punctuated by a c. 450-yr episode of lake dilution centered on 11 000 cal. yr BP. Maximum evaporative concentration of lake waters, registered in both delta O-18 values and mineralogy of endogenic carbonates, coincided with the early-Holocene peak in insolation seasonality at about 9750 cal. yr BP. Subsequently, progressively decreasing lake residence time drove a sustained long-term decline in salinity while having a very subdued effect on mean delta O-18 values. e explain this decoupling by (1) limits placed on oxygen isotope sensitivity by groundwater throughflow, and (2) a shift toward greater summer rain contribution to lake inflow after mid-Holocene time. Superimposed multidecadal- and century-scale variation in lake-groundwater exchange generated high-frequency but low-amplitude isotopic oscillations throughout the record. High rates of groundwater throughflow maintaining low lake salinity similar to that observed today were established around 1400 cal. yr BP. e infer reduced regional stream baseflow, decrease in permanent wetlands (relative increase in ephemeral wetlands) and enhanced lake and wetland salinity prior to this time, relative to the late Holocene." ;

The n-alkane profiles indicated a major input from terrigenous plants [predominance of high molecular weight (HMW) alkanes] since ca. 1695 AD to the water body, although the uppermost cm revealed a predominance of organic matter (OM) derived from algae, as the most abundant alkane was C17. Three units revealing different environmental conditions were defined. Unit A (ca. 1695-1860 AD) in the lowermost parts of ENO13-10 (<12 cm) and ENO13-15 (<28 cm) was identified and was characterized by higher OM input and evidence of minimal degradation (high CPI values, predominance of HMW n-alkanoic acids and good correspondence between the predominant n-alkane and n-alkanoic acid chains). These findings could be linked to the Little Ice Age, when cold and humid conditions may have favored an increase in total organic carbon (TOC) and n-alkane and n-alkanoic acid content (greater terrigenous OM in-wash), and may have also reduced bacterial activity. In Unit B (ca. 1860-1980 AD) the lack of correspondence between the n-alkane and n-alkanoic acid profiles of ENO13-10 (12-4 cm) and ENO13-15 (28-8 cm) suggested a certain preferential microbial synthesis of long chain saturated fatty acids from primary OM and/or bacterial activity, coinciding with a decrease in OM input, which could be linked to the global warming that started in the second half of the 19th century. In ENO13-7 the low OM input (low TOC) was accompanied by some bacterial degradation (predominance of HMW n-alkanoic acids but with a bimodal distribution) in the lowermost 16-5 cm. Evidence of considerable phytoplankton productivity and microbial activity was especially significant in Unit C (ca. 1980-2013 AD) identified in the uppermost part of all three cores (5 cm in ENO13-7, 4 cm in ENO13-10 and 8cm in ENO13-15), coinciding with higher concentrations of n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids, which were considered to be linked to warmer and drier conditions, as well as to greater anthropogenic influence in modern times.Plant sterols, such as -sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol, were significantly present in the cores. In addition, fecal stanols, such as 24-ethylcoprostanol from herbivores, were present, thereby indicating a continuous and significant pollution input derived from these animals since the 17th century, being more important in the last 20 years." ;

Are presence and abundance of taxa independent of environmental variability? Location: Lake Peten-Itza, Guatemala, Central American lowlands. Methods: We use an 86 000-yr-long pollen record to study the relative contribution of neutral mechanisms and environmental determinism in configuring vegetation in the Central American lowlands. By using variance ratios, we evaluated the role of neutral drift at community and functional group levels. Additionally, regression analyses were applied to explain persistence and abundance of individual taxa as a function of regional moisture availability and fire frequency. Results: Environmental fluctuations drove vegetation dynamics in the Central American lowlands during the late Pleistocene. When the data set was stratified according to moisture availability and fire frequency, variance ratios further supported our findings. Regression analyses revealed that whereas species' presence was independent of both moisture availability and fire frequency, their abundance was closely associated with both. Conclusions: Neutrality, probably expressed in the face of stressors, through factors such as the existence of microrefugia, survival of relictual individuals and phenotypic and phenologic plasticity, was probably crucial in preventing biodiversity losses. Climate, however, was the main driver of vegetation dynamics in the Yucatan Peninsula during the late Pleistocene.  2013 International Association for Vegetation Science." ;

Fuel sources and fire regimes in the upper Midwestern United States have been shown to be sensitive to regional climatic variability, such as drought periods on millennial timescales. Yet, records documenting the connections between disturbance activity and the corresponding fuel source fluctuations in mesic deciduous forests and prairie/oak savanna in this region are limited. Thus, it has been difficult to provide a framework to evaluate changes in moisture availability on fire activity and the relationships with fuel source fluctuations in this region. We present high-resolution charcoal analyses of lake sediments from four sites in southern Wisconsin (USA) to characterize fire activity and fuel source fluctuation in mesic deciduous forests and prairie/oak savanna over the last 10 000 years. We found that fire occurrence across the four study sites has been asynchronous throughout the Holocene, because of site-specific differences that have strongly influenced local fire regimes. Additionally, we found that during periods of high fire activity the primary fuels were from arboreal sources, and during periods of low fire activity the primary fuels were from non-arboreal sources. However, fluctuations in fuel sources did not always correspond to changes in vegetation, or changes in fire frequency.  2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd." ;

LIS retreat from Superior opened eastern Lake Agassiz outlets so that the rhythmites reflect the combined impacts of sediment-laden meltwater and Lake Agassiz discharge. Multiple rhythmite stratigraphies, a time series analysis of the thickness measurements, and high-resolution inorganic carbonate data demonstrate that this is an annual record (varved). The varve thickness records primarily document regional ice margin dynamics; correlative thick varve sequences at 9100 cal ybp [ 8.1 14C ka] and 10,400-10,200 cal ybp [ 9.2-9.0 14C ka] record two periods of enhanced glaciofluvial discharge, most likely moraine formation (the Nakina and Nipigon). General varve cessation is associated with the circumvention of Lake Agassiz and glacial meltwater into Lake Ojibway at 9040 cal ybp [ 8.1 14C ka], although adjacent to the inlets from Lake Nipigon, rhythmic sedimentation persisted for 200 years. Positively identifying Lake Agassiz catastrophic discharge events remains speculative but seems feasible. Following retreat of Marquette ice that had re-advanced to fill the basin, the initial influx of Lake Agassiz water is expected at around 10,600 cal ybp [ 9.4 14C ka], but at this time, most of northeastern Lake Superior was covered by ice. Three sets of thick-thin varves in western Lake Superior perhaps record influxes of Lake Agassiz at around 10,630, 10,600, and 10,570 cal ybp [ 9.4 14C ka]. Varve formation in Superior coincides with high lake levels in Lake Huron, suggesting that high lake levels in Huron correspond to periods of high Agassiz and/or meltwater flow into Lake Superior.  2007 Elsevier B.V.

Pollen studies of the lower 216m of the lacustrine sediments demonstrate their value as an excellent archive of vegetation and climate changes during the Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene. About 3.5-3.35 Myr BP, the vegetation at Lake El'gygytgyn, now an area of tundra was dominated by spruce-larch-fir-hemlock forests. After ca. 3.35 Myr BP dark coniferous taxa gradually disappeared. A very pronounced environmental change took place ca. 3.31-3.28 Myr BP, corresponding to the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) M2, when treeless tundra- and steppe-like habitats became dominant in the regional vegetation. Climate conditions were similar to those of Late Pleistocene cold intervals. Numerous coprophilous fungi spores identified in the pollen samples suggest the presence of grazing animals around the lake. Following the MIS M2 event, larch-pine forests with some spruce mostly dominated the area until ca. 2.6 Myr BP, interrupted by colder and drier intervals ca. 3.043-3.025, 2.935-2.912, and 2.719-2.698 Myr BP. At the beginning of the Pleistocene, ca. 2.6 Myr BP, noticeable climatic deterioration occurred. Forested habitats changed to predominantly treeless and shrubby environments, which reflect a relatively cold and dry climate. Peaks in observed green algae colonies (Botryococcus) around 2.53, 2.45, 2.32-2.305, 2.20 and 2.16-2.15 Myr BP suggest a spread of shallow water environments. A few intervals (i.e., 2.55-2.53, ca. 2.37, and 2.35-2.32 Myr BP) with a higher presence of coniferous taxa (mostly pine and larch) document some relatively shortterm climate ameliorations during Early Pleistocene glacial periods.

The sediment records from deep water consist mainly of alternating clay, gypsum and carbonate units and, in at least two drill sites, extend back >200 kyr. Most of the lithostratigraphic units are traceable throughout the basin along seismic reflections that serve as seismic stratigraphic boundaries and suggest that the lithostratigraphy can be used to infer regional palaeoenvironmental changes. A revised seismic stratigraphy was established on the basis of integrated lithological and seismic reflection data from the basin. From ca 200 to ca 85 ka, sediments are dominated by carbonate-clay silt, often interbedded with sandy turbidites, indicating a sediment regime dominated by detrital sedimentation in a relatively humid climate. At ca 85 ka, an exposure horizon consisting of gravels, coarse sand and terrestrial gastropods marks a lake lowstand or partial basin desiccation, indicating dry climate conditions. From ca 85 to ca 48 ka, transgressive carbonate-clay sediments, overlain by deep-water clays, suggest a lake level rise and subsequent stabilization at high stage. From ca 48 ka to present, the lithology is characterized by alternating clay and gypsum units. Gypsum deposition correlates with Heinrich Events (i.e. dry climate), whereas clay units coincide with more humid interstadials.  2010 The Authors.

Previous studies have recognized the impacts of a warmer, more arid climate and Mongolia's 1991 transition from a command to a market economy on terrestrial ecosystems, including impaired sustainability of subsistence herding and threats to wild animals. In this study, we examined the combined effects of changing climate and herding practices on lake eutrophication in Western Mongolia. We sampled 65 lakes for modern nutrients and found the majority of lakes were eutrophic to hyper-eutrophic. Sediment cores were taken from five of the lakes to compare current lake status to paleolimnologial measures of lake eutrophication over the past 100-2000 years, including changes in diatom assemblages, diatom-inferred total phosphorus, biogenic silica, organic matter, and sediment accumulation rates. Variance partitioning analysis showed that recent shifts in diatom assemblages were related to changes in both climate and herding practices. The results presented here demonstrate a need for further study and long-term monitoring of water quality in Mongolia to understand the complicated interactions of climate and land use on aquatic resources and to preserve water quality in this remote and ecologically important region.  2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC." ;

We measured VNIR spectra of lake and river sediments from Lake Towuti and its catchment to identify clay minerals, fit major VNIR absorption features with a modified Gaussian model to estimate relative abundances of these minerals, and compared these absorptions to the samples chemistry to test the utility of VNIR spectroscopy to characterize sediment compositional variations. We found that major absorptions are caused by vibrations of AlOH in kaolinite (2.21 m), FeOH in nontronite (2.29 m), MgOH in saponite and serpentine (2.31 m), and MgOH in serpentine (2.34 m). This was confirmed with X-ray diffraction data. The correlations between absorption band areas for FeOH, AlOH, and MgOH vibrations and Fe, Al and Mg concentrations, respectively, are statistically significant, varying between r = 0.51 and r = 0.90, and spatial variations in inferred clay mineralogy within the lake are consistent with variations in the geology of the catchment. We conclude that VNIR spectroscopy is an effective way to characterize the clay mineralogy of lake sediments, and can be used to investigate changes in mineral inputs to lake deposits." ;

The Mn-carbonate is authigenic and forms rims around contemporaneous epilimnetic calcite. Although such carbonates are found in minor amounts throughout the entire late-glacial sequence, significant quantities of Mn-carbonate are associated mainly with laminated intervals. Because of the suspected difference in isotopic fractionation between different carbonate minerals, the stable-isotopic compositions of bulk carbonate samples are used as a proxy for relative amounts of the Mn-carbonate in the sediment. High 18O and low 13 C values are associated with abundant Mn-carbonates. Low 18O and high 13C values are associated with only minor concentrations of Mn-carbonates. The oxygen-18 record is correlated with fluctuations in the vegetation assemblage based on pollen spectra using a multiple regression model with backward elimination. The proposed link between the sedimentary archive and local vegetation is the mediation of advective mixing in the lake by forest composition. In this model, periods of forest closure resulted in a well-stratified water column that was anoxic at the sediment/water interface, permitting the formation of authigenic Mn-carbonates. Openings of Artemisia in the forest allowed wind shear to mix oxygen to depth, causing bioturbation of the laminations and preventing the formation of Mn-carbonate." ;

Between 11,700 and 9500 14C yr B.P., the climate was cool and moist. A gradual decrease in effective moisture occurred between 9500 and 7100 14C yr B.P. A change at about 7100 14C yr B.P. inaugurated the most arid period during the Holocene. Between 7100 and 4000 14C yr B.P., three arid phases occurred at 6600-6200 14C yr B.P., 5400-5200 14C yr B.P., and 4800-4600 14C yr B.P. Effective moisture generally increased after 4000 14C yr B.P., but periods of low effective moisture occurred between 2900-2800 14C yr B.P. and 1200-800 14C yr B.P. The data also suggest high climatic variability during the last few centuries. Despite the overall congruence, the biological (diatom), sedimentological, isotopic, and chemical proxies were occassionally out of phase. At these times the evaporative process was not the only control of lake-water chemical and isotopic composition.  1997 University of Washington." ;

A high-resolution record, derived from the deep drilling of sediments on the floor of Lake Titicaca in the southern tropical Andes, is presented that shows clear evidence of millennial-scale climate variation between 60 and 20 ka BP. This variation is manifested by alternations of two interbedded sedimentary units. The two units have distinctive sedimentary, geochemical, and paleobiotic properties that are controlled by the relative abundance of terrigenous or nearshore components versus pelagic components. The sediments of more terrigenous or nearshore nature likely were deposited during regionally wetter climates when river transport of water and sediment was higher, whereas the sediments of more pelagic character were deposited during somewhat drier climates regionally. The majority of the wet periods inferred from the Lake Titicaca sediment record are correlated with the cold events in the Greenland ice cores and North Atlantic sediment cores, indicating that increased intensity of the South American summer monsoon was part of near-global scale climate excursions.  2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we use scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray analysis (SEM/EDS) to study the pitting of feldspars in soils and lake sediments at two sites in the Great Lakes region, USA. A semi-quantitative feldspar weathering index (FWI) allows description of the weathering status for large numbers of individual grains, and reveals differences among soil horizons and strata of lake sediment as well as between the two sites. Feldspars in upper soil horizons generally have greater FWI than those in lower horizons, but analyses also suggest considerable weathering in the soil C horizon at the site with more rapid water infiltration. At one site, the FWI of upper soil horizons and surface lake sediment are similar, implying that lake sediments have the potential to record changes in soil over time. However, differences between upper soil horizons and surface sediment at the other site highlight the need to examine more sites and more profiles within sites to better relate catchment and sediment characteristics. We interpret increases in the FWI over time within lake sediments as evidence of progressive weathering of soils and conclude that the sites had different histories of soil development. However, the complexities of sediment deposition in lakes and the paucity of information relating FWI to soil characteristics prevent straightforward reconstruction of soil development. Variability within each record appears tied to initial grain chemistry, depositional environment, changes in lake level and progressive degradation of grains. As more information relating micromorphology to soil characteristics becomes available, this technique should become a more useful complement to chemical studies of lake sediment." ;

While moraines can provide snapshots of glacier extent, high-resolution records of environmental response to the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, Younger Dryas cooling, and subsequent warming into the stable Holocene are rare. We describe the transition from the late Pleistocene to the Holocene using a ~ 17,000-yr sediment record from Swiftcurrent Lake in eastern Glacier National Park, MT, with a focus on the period from ~ 17 to 11 ka. Total organic and inorganic carbon, grain size, and carbon/nitrogen data provide evidence for glacial retreat from the late Pleistocene into the Holocene, with the exception of a well-constrained advance during the Younger Dryas from 12.75 to 11.5 ka. Increased detrital carbonate concentration in Swiftcurrent Lake sediment reflects enhanced glacial erosion and sediment transport, likely a result of a more proximal ice terminus position and a reduction in the number of alpine lakes acting as sediment sinks in the valley." ;

However, one of the main challenges associated with generating long paleoclimate time series from terrestrial records such as this is the development of accurate age-depth relationships because unlike marine records, lacustrine sequences cannot be tuned to global ice volume records via 18O stratigraphy. The Lake Bosumtwi record thus offers an excellent case study for examining the potential and the challenges associated with different geochronological techniques in lacustrine systems. In the present study, we use a combination of radiocarbon, optically stimulated luminescence and U-series dating and paleomagnetic excursions to generate a chronology for the upper ca. 150 ka of sedimentation at Lake Bosumtwi and employ a Bayesian approach to generate a continuous age-depth relationship. The resultant chronology is then used to test the effectiveness of tuning of an environmental magnetic proxy for dust against a well-dated record of high latitude dust. Our approach highlights the advantages of using multiple dating approaches, and the dangers of relying on too few age constraints when dating long sedimentary sequences. However, the excellent agreement between the different approaches over most of the record suggest that well-constrained age-depth models for long sedimentary sequences can be produced using this combination of approaches. Furthermore, our data provide support for extending the chronology beyond the limit of radiocarbon, U-series and OSL in the future using paleomagnetic excursions/reversals and tuning against well-dated high latitude paleoclimate records.  2012 Elsevier B.V." ;

Unfortunately none of these factors are fully understood. Sediment cores from Fenton Lake and other sites in the Lake Superior basin have been used to document constantly falling water levels in glacial Lake Minong between 9,000 and 10,600 cal (8.19.5 ka) BP. Over three meters of previously unrecovered sediment from Fenton Lake detail a more complex lake level history than formerly realized, and consists of an early regression, transgression, and final regression. The initial regression is documented by a transition from gray, clayey silt to black sapropelic silt. The transgression is recorded by an abrupt return to gray sand and silt, and dates between 9,000 and 9,500 cal (8.18.6 ka) BP. The transgression could be the result of increased discharge from Lake Agassiz overflow or the Laurentide Ice Sheet, and hydraulic damming at the Lake Minong outlet. Alternatively ice advance in northern Ontario may have blocked an unrecognized low level northern outlet to glacial Lake Ojibway, which switched Lake Minong overflow back to the Lake Huron basin and raised lake levels. Multiple sites in the Lake Huron and Michigan basins suggest increased meltwater discharges occurred around the time of the transgression in Lake Minong, suggesting a possible linkage. The final regression in Fenton Lake is documented by a return to black sapropelic silt, which coincides with varve cessation in the Superior basin when Lake Agassiz overflow and glacial meltwater was diverted to glacial Lake Ojibway in northern Ontario." ;

We present a case from the northern Great Plains in which Holocene drought response recorded in lake sediments was determined by changes in chemical characteristics of source ground water. Middle Holocene ostracode assemblages were dominated by halophylic Limnocythere stapling indicating increased lake-water salinity, yet the oxygen isotope values in this period decreased by 2 to 3, contrary to expectations of evaporative dominance. We infer from these proxy records and ground-water flow-model results that the paleoclimatic record in the lake was mediated by changes in ground-water catchment area and by reduction in evapo-transpiration accompanying desiccation of peripheral lake basins." ;

Lake-level fluctuations on the order of hundreds of meters were inferred from dramatic changes in the fossil and sedimentary archives. Many of the fossil diatom assemblages we observed have no analog in modern Lake Malawi. Cyclotelloid diatom species are a major component of fossil assemblages prior to 35. ka, but are not found in significant abundances in the modern diatom communities in Lake Malawi. Salinity- and alkalinity-tolerant plankton has not been reported in the modern lake system, but frequently dominant fossil diatom assemblages prior to 85. ka. Large stephanodiscoid species that often dominate the plankton today are rarely present in the fossil record prior to 31. ka. Similarly, prior to 31. ka, common central-basin aulacoseiroid species are replaced by species found in the shallow, well-mixed southern basin. Surprisingly, tychoplankton and periphyton were not common throughout prolonged lowstands, but tended to increase in relative abundance during periods of inferred deeper-lake environments. A high-resolution lake level reconstruction was generated by a principle component analysis of fossil diatom and wet-sieved fossil and mineralogical residue records. Prior to 70. ka, fossil assemblages suggest that the central basin was periodically a much shallower, more saline and/or alkaline, well-mixed environment. The most significant reconstructed lowstands are ~. 600. m below the modern lake level and span thousands of years. These conditions contrast starkly with the deep, dilute, dysaerobic environments of the modern central basin. After 70. ka, our reconstruction indicates sustained deeper-water environments were common, marked by a few brief, but significant, lowstands. High amplitude lake-level fluctuations appear related to changes in insolation. Seismic reflection data and additional sediment cores recovered from the northern basin of Lake Malawi provide evidence that supports our reconstruction.  2010 Elsevier B.V." ;

However, increased clastic sedimentation has been interpreted to indicate both glacial advance and recession. Here we examine the timing of clastic sediment deposition in Challpacocha, a glacially fed lake located downvalley from Quelccaya Ice Cap (QIC), Peru, in comparison with known ice cap margin fluctuations. Using a comparison with a nearby non-glacial lake, Yanacocha, we document that a record of clastic sediment flux from Challpacocha reflects meltwater-derived sediment. We then compare the clastic sediment record from Challpacocha with the Qori Kalis glacier moraine record. We find that organic-rich sediment was deposited primarily during the late Holocene advance of QIC (before ~CE 1490). In contrast, clastic sediment was deposited during QIC recession (~CE 1490-1970). Peaks in clastic sediment flux are associated with the onset of ice retreat. We suggest that this pattern of clastic sediment deposition reflects changing meltwater production and/or glacial erosion during ice advance and retreat and supports models of increased clastic sedimentation during ice retreat." ;

Larger calibration sample sets yield better inferences because they better characterize the environmental characteristics and species assemblages of the sample region. To optimize inferred information from fossil assemblages, however, it is worth knowing if fewer calibration samples can be used. Furthermore, confidence in environmental reconstructions is greater if we consider the relative importance of (A) similarity between fossil and calibration assemblages and (B) how well fossil taxa respond to the environmental variable of interest. We examine these issues using ~200-year sediment profiles from four Minnesota lakes and a 145-lake surface sediment training set calibrated for total phosphorus (TP). Training set sample sizes ranging from 10 to 145 were created through random sample selection, and models based on these training sets were used to calculate diatom-inferred (DI) TP data from fossil samples. Relationships between DI-TP variability and sample size were used to determine the minimum sample size needed to optimize the model for paleo-reconstruction. Similarly, similarities between fossil and modern assemblages were calculated for each size training set. Finally, fossil and modern assemblages were compared to determine whether older fossil samples had poorer similarity with modern analogs. More than 50-80 samples, depending on lake, were needed to stabilize variability in DI-TP results, and >110 training set samples were needed to minimize modern-fossil assemblage dissimilarities. Dissimilarities appeared to increase with sample age, but only one of the four studied cores displayed a significant trend. We have two recommendations for future studies: (1) be cautious when dealing with smaller training sets, especially if they are used to interpret older fossil assemblages and (2) understand how well fossil taxa are attuned to the variable of interest, as it is critical to evaluating the quality of the diatom-inferred data.  2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht." ;

Drought caused an observed 4.0 to 5.1m lake-head decline between 1923 and 1938; all but three either dried completely or declined to < 1.7 m depth. From the deepest (Elk Lake), a 210Pb-dated sediment core was analyzed for ostracode species distribution and geochemistry of C. Rawsoni shells (18O, 13C, Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca). Mg/Ca and 13C increased during drought at the same time that salinity-tolerant ostracodes thrived, suggesting increasing salinity. However, 18O decreased during drought, anti-correlative with Mg/Ca. A numerical model for transient response of groundwater flow to drought, modeled after that of 1923-38, was constrained by drought-end recessional strand lines observed on air photos of one lake, with strand line elevations inferred from bathymetry. Simulated lake-water-level declines in the first 15 drought years were consistent with strand line elevations. The rate of decline was exponential at drought onset, slowing as water in lakes and wetlands receded to below land surface and lake evaporation declined. A near-steady state was attained between 40 and 50 simulation years after onset of drought, with the water table from 1-5 m below the level of dry lakebeds and only the two deepest lakes still holding water. They were, however, greatly constricted in area and depth. Simulated evaporation fluxes were reduced by over 50% within 15 years, despite increased ET rates, due to lake area constriction and water table declines. Both relate to land surface morphology beneath and around lakes. Model results suggest that lake-bed elevations exert control on the rate and ultimate level to which groundwater is depressed by drought. The deepest lakes in any region will tend to become the focus of groundwater flow during sustained drought once lakes around it dry out. The unexpected finding of decreasing shell 18O in response to drought is interpreted as some combination of source and/or evaporation - reduction effects, such as seasonality of recharge/precipitation or reduced ET flux from wetlands that seep back into lakes.  2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd." ;

An internally consistent stratigraphy was constructed from calcium carbonate abundance and variations in the two most abundant diatom genera, Stephanodiscus and Melosira, with age control obtained primarily from 14C dating of the carbonate. Differences with time in Fe abundance in a transect of cores from different water depths have been interpreted to reflect changes in chemocline depth. The depth to the chemocline was on the order of 100 m shallower than present prior to 3500 yr B.P., indicating less seasonality. Carbonate production and preservation appears to be related to climatically induced changes in both salinity and chemical distributions in the water column. The carbonate, which precipitates from surface waters, is most abundant during the interval from about 10,000 to 6000 yr B.P. This micrite most likely represents periods of low lake level when salinity increased and carbonate precipitation was enhanced. Sedimentary evidence suggests that lake levels were 100-150 m lower than present during this period. This record is different from climatic trends in northern intertropical Africa, but appears to also be related to changes in insolation and monsoon circulation. This is the northernmost basin in Africa reported to exhibit a \"southern hemisphere\" response to the early Holocene northern hemisphere summer insolation maximum. The climatic hingeline north of Lake Malawi ( 9S) implied by our results is significantly south of that indicated by general-circulation model simulations, however. The cores show evidence for periods of abrupt climate change during the interval of generally arid climate.  1991." ;

Based on remote sensing and GIS techniques together with bathymetric survey and water balance analysis, we show how climatic changes and glacier mass loss have influenced the inland lake dynamics on the central TP. Our results show that six closed lakes (Siling Co, Nam Co, Bam Co, Pung Co, Darab Co and Zige Tangco) expanded by 20.2% in area, by 8.7. m in water depth, and by 37.7. Gt in the total storage between 1976 and 2010, with a remarkable acceleration after 1999. The growth rate of lake area, water level and storage between 1999 and 2010 was 5.0, 3.6 and 4.8 times, respectively, than that between 1976 and 1999, corresponding well with the significant climatic changes in the late 1990s. Water balance analysis shows that increased precipitation and runoff, and decreased lake evaporation were the main causes for the coherent lake growth and could contribute by about 70% of total increase in lake storage. Based on modern mass balance results , glacier mass loss between 1999 and 2010 was estimated to contribute to the lake level rise of the three glacial-fed lakes, Siling Co, Nam Co and Pung Co, by ~1.0. m, ~0.7. m and ~1.1. m, respectively, accounting for 11.7%, 28.7% and 11.4% of the total lake level rise.  2013 Elsevier B.V." ;

Unfortunately, these assumptions can be difficult to test across long timescales because the chronology, cumulative mass, and completeness of a sedimentary profile are often difficult to establish. We therefore made a detailed analysis of a core from the principal drainage outlet of the Everglades of South Florida in order to assess these problems and determine the factors that could govern carbon accumulation in this large subtropical wetland. Accelerator mass spectroscopy dating provided direct evidence for both hard-water and open-system sources of dating errors, whereas cumulative mass varied depending upon the type of method used. Radiocarbon dates of gastropod shells, nevertheless, seemed to provide a reliable chronology for this core once the hard-water error was quantified and subtracted. Long-term accumulation rates were then calculated to be 12.1 g m-2 yr-1 for carbon, which is less than half the average rate reported for northern and tropical peatlands. Moreover, accumulation rates remained slow and relatively steady for both organic and inorganic strata, and the slow rate of sediment accretion (0.2 mm yr -1) tracked the correspondingly slow rise in sea level (0.35 mm yr-1) reported for South Florida over the past 4000 years. These results suggest that sea level and the local geologic setting may impose long-term constraints on rates of sediment and carbon accumulation in the Everglades and other wetlands.  2012.

Isotope hydrology data from the southern Yukon indicate that the oxygen isotope composition of water from Jellybean Lake reflects the composition of mean-annual precipitation, delta(18)O(p). Recent changes in the delta(18)O of Jellybean sedimentary calcite (delta(18)O(ca)) correspond to changes in the North Pacific Index (NPI), a measure of the intensity and position of the Aleutian Low (AL) pressure system. This Suggests that delta(18)O(p) variability was related to the degree of fractionation during moisture transport from the Gulf of Alaska across the St. Elias Mountains and that Holocene shifts were controlled by the intensity and position of the AL. Following this model, between similar to 7500 and 4500 cal yr B.P., long-term trends suggest a predominantly weaker and/or westward AL. Between similar to 4500 and 3000 cal yr B.P. the AL shifted eastward or intensified before shifting westward or weakening between similar to 3000 and 2000 cal yr B.P. Rapid shifts eastward and/or intensification occurred similar to 1200 and 300 cal yr B.P. Holocene changes in North Pacific atmospheric circulation inferred from Jellybean Lake oxygen isotopes correspond with late Holocene glacial advances in the St. Elias Mountains, changes in North Pacific salmon abundance, and shifts in atmospheric circulation over the Beaufort Sea.

Proxies, such as sedimentary charcoal and tree-ring fire scars, have temporal or spatial limitations and do not directly detect fire intensity. We show in this study that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) produced during wildfires record local fire events and fire intensity. We demonstrate that high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detector (HPLC-FLD) is superior to gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GCMS) for detecting the low concentrations of sedimentary PAHs derived from natural fires. The HPLC-FLD is at least twice as sensitive as the GCMS in selective ion monitoring (SIM) mode for parent PAHs and five times as sensitive for retene. The annual samples extracted from varved sediments from Swamp Lake in Yosemite National Park, California are compared with the observational fire history record and show that PAH fluxes record fires within 0.5 km of the lake. The low molecular weight (LMW) PAHs (e.g., fluoranthene, pyrene and benz[a]anthracene) are the best recorders of fire, whereas the high molecular weight (HMW) PAHs likely record fire intensity. PAHs appear to resolve some of the issues inherent to other fire proxies, such as secondary deposition of charcoal. This study advances our understanding of how PAHs can be used as markers for fire events and poses new questions regarding the distribution of these compounds in the environment." ;

Five new diatom records from Ugandan waters now show that a transition from Aulacoseira-dominated planktonic assemblages to those dominated by long Nitzschia spp., occurred in northern coastal sites from the mid-1970s to mid-1980s. Similar transitions developed from the late 1960s to early 1970s offshore and from the 1940s to early 1950s along the Kenyan coast, suggesting a time-transgressive process. These changes are not readily attributable to the trophic effects of Nile perch population growth during the early 1980s, but more likely reflect responses to long-term nutrient enrichment and climatic instability in the region. The diversity of planktonic diatom communities has declined dramatically, and a namesake variety of Aulacoseira nyassensis may now be nearly extirpated. Although local phytoplankton communities varied considerably in the past, the current domination of diatom assemblages by Nitzschia is apparently unprecedented in the 15,000-year history of Lake Victoria." ;

Patterns of change at 12,000, 9000, 6000 and 4000 cal yr BP are presented to capture the nature of change from the Younger Dryas (YD) and through the mid-Holocene. At the YD, conditions were cooler overall, wetter in the north and drier in the south, while moving into the Holocene wetter conditions became established in the south and then spread north as the NAM strengthened. Until c. 8000 cal yr BP, the Laurentide Ice Sheet influenced precipitation in the north by pushing the Bermuda High further south. The peak extent of the NAM seems to have occurred around 6000 cal yr BP. 4000 cal yr BP marks the start of important changes across the NAM region, with drying in the north and the establishment of the clear differences between the summer-rain dominated south and central areas and the north, where winter rain is more important. This differentiation between south and north is crucial to understanding many climate responses across the NAM. This increasing variability is coincident with the declining influence of orbital forcing. 4000 cal yr BP also marks the onset of significant anthropogenic activity in many areas. For the last 2000 years, the focus is on higher temporal resolution change, with strong variations across the region. The Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) is characterised by centennial scale megadrought across the southwest USA, associated with cooler tropical Pacific SSTs and persistent La Nina type conditions. Proxy data from southern Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean reveal generally wetter conditions, whereas records from the highlands of central Mexico and much of the Yucatan are typified by long -term drought. The Little Ice Age (LIA), in the north, was characterised by cooler, wetter winter conditions that have been linked with increased frequency of El Nino's. Proxy records in the central and southern regions reveal generally dry LIA conditions, consistent with cooler SSTs in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. This synthesis demonstrates that in some periods, one major forcing can dominate across the whole area (e.g. insolation in the early-mid Holocene), but at other times there is strong variability in patterns of change due to the differential impact of forcings such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) on precipitation seasonality." ;

The lakes span three natural ecoregions, which differ in their history of land use, as well as in surficial geology, climate, and vegetation. Postsettlement trends were compared with water chemistry change reconstructed from two presettlement core sections (circa 1750 and 1800) as a measure of natural variability. Presettlement water quality changes were generally small and nondirectional in all three ecoregions. In contrast, half of the urban lakes showed a statistically significant increase in chloride, whereas 30% of urban and 30% of agricultural region lakes record a statistically significant increase in total phosphorus between 1800 and the present. These changes, which are attributed to road salt and nutrient runoff, are strongly correlated with the percentage of watershed area that is developed (residential or urban) in the case of chloride increases and the percentage of developed (metropolitan areas) or agricultural (agricultural areas) land in the case of nutrient increases. Water quality has changed little since 1800 for lakes in the forested regions of northeastern Minnesota. The few changes that are seen in this region are likely related to natural variations in climate or catchment soils." ;

Average temperature during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5A was 26.5 C, with a range from 25.7 to 27.3 C, comparable to Holocene temperatures. MIS 4 was a relatively cold period with temperatures generally decreasing from 25.5 C at 68 ka to a minimum of 20 C at ~ 60 ka, 1.5-2 C colder than the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Termination of MIS 4 is characterized by a rapid increase of 3-4 C in only ~ 0.5 kyr. Temperatures were relatively stable throughout MIS 3 at the resolution of this study, with an average of 23.8 C and a range from 25.1 to 22.9 C. The lack of millennial-scale temperature variability during MIS 3 suggests that Lake Malawi's documented response to the bipolar seesaw (Brown et al., 2007) is not reflected in its thermal history. Our temperature estimates for the LGM and Holocene are consistent with a previously published TEX86 record from Lake Malawi with a temperature of ~ 22.6 C for the LGM, ~ 25-26 C in the mid Holocene and ~ 25-28 for the late Holocene. In general the present extended TEX86 record indicates that temperature variability in tropical East Africa during late MIS 5 and MIS 4 was as great as that associated with the deglaciation and Holocene. A decrease in Southern Hemisphere insolation between 70 and 60 ka may have played an important role in forcing temperatures during MIS 4, but after 60 ka other factors, such as the extent of the polar ice sheets, or atmospheric CO2 may have forced temperature in tropical Africa to a greater extent than local summer insolation." ;

The long-term evolution of thermokarst landscapes and the stability and longevity of lakes depend upon climate, vegetation and ground conditions, including the volume of excess ground ice and its distribution. The current lake status of thermokarst-lake landscapes and their future trajectories under climate warming are better understood in the light of their long-term development. We studied the lake-rich southern marginal upland of the Yukon Flats (northern interior Alaska) using dated lake-sediment cores, observations of river-cut exposures, and remotely-sensed data. The region features thick (up to 40m) Quaternary deposits (mainly loess) that contain massive ground ice. Two of three studied lakes formed ~11,000-12,000calyr BP through inferred thermokarst processes, and fire may have played a role in initiating thermokarst development. From ~9000calyr BP, all lakes exhibited steady sedimentation, and pollen stratigraphies are consistent with regional patterns. The current lake expansion rates are low (0 to <7cmyr-1 shoreline retreat) compared with other regions (~30cmyr-1 or more). This thermokarst lake-rich region does not show evidence of extensive landscape lowering by lake drainage, nor of multiple lake generations within a basin. However, LiDAR images reveal linear \"corrugations\" (>5m amplitude), deep thermo-erosional gullies, and features resembling lake drainage channels, suggesting that highly dynamic surface processes have previously shaped the landscape. Evidently, widespread early Holocene permafrost degradation and thermokarst lake initiation were followed by lake longevity and landscape stabilization, the latter possibly related to establishment of dense forest cover. Partial or complete drainage of three lakes in 2013 reveals that there is some contemporary landscape dynamism. Holocene landscape evolution in the study area differs from that described from other thermokarst-affected regions; regional responses to future environmental change may be equally individualistic." ;

We present a record of East African climate since 55 ka, preserved in Lake Malawi sediments, that indicates rapid shifts between discrete climate modes related to abrupt warming (D-O) events observed in Greenland. Although the timing of the Malawi events cannot be determined exactly, our age model implies that they occur prior to their Greenland counterparts, consistent with southward excursions of the Intertropical Convergence Zone during Greenland stadials. The magnitude of each of the events recorded in Malawi sediments corresponds to the scale of the subsequent Greenland warming. This suggests that a tropical component of climate sets a template for abrupt high northern latitude climate fluctuations associated with the bipolar seesaw.

Surficial deposits in the Bear Lake drainage basin provide a geologic context for interpretation of cores from Bear Lake deposits. In addition to groundwater discharge, Bear Lake received water and sediment from its own small drainage basin and sometimes from the Bear River and its glaciated headwaters. The lake basin interacts with the river in complex ways that are modulated by climatically induced lake-level changes, by the distribution of active Quaternary faults, and by the migration of the river across its fluvial fan north of the present lake.The upper Bear River flows northward for ~150 km from its headwaters in the northwestern Uinta Mountains, generally following the strike of regional Laramide and late Cenozoic structures. These structures likely also control the flow paths of groundwater that feeds Bear Lake, and groundwater-fed streams are the largest source of water when the lake is isolated from the Bear River. The present configuration of the Bear River with respect to Bear Lake Valley may not have been established until the late Pliocene. The absence of Uinta Rangederived quartzites in fluvial gravel on the crest of the Bear Lake Plateau east of Bear Lake suggests that the present headwaters were not part of the drainage basin in the late Tertiary. Newly mapped glacial deposits in the Bear River Range west of Bear Lake indicate several advances of valley glaciers that were probably coeval with glaciations in the Uinta Mountains. Much of the meltwater from these glaciers may have reached Bear Lake via ground-water pathways through infiltration in the karst terrain of the Bear River Range.At times during the Pleistocene, the Bear River flowed into Bear Lake and water level rose to the valley threshold at Nounan narrows. This threshold has been modified by aggradation, downcutting, and tectonics. Maximum lake levels have decreased from as high as 1830 m to 1806 m above sea level since the early Pleistocene due to episodic downcutting by the Bear River. The oldest exposed lacustrine sediments in Bear Lake Valley are probably of Pliocene age. Several high-lake phases during the early and middle Pleistocene were separated by episodes of fluvial incision. Threshold incision was not constant, however, because lake highstands of as much as 8 m above bedrock threshold level resulted from aggradation and possibly landsliding at least twice during the late-middle and late Pleistocene. Abandoned stream channels within the low-lying, fault-bounded region between Bear Lake and the modern Bear River show that Bear River progressively shifted northward during the Holocene. Several factors including faulting, location of the fluvial fan, and channel migration across the fluvial fan probably interacted to produce these changes in channel position.Late Quaternary slip rates on the east Bear Lake fault zone are estimated by using the water-level history of Bear Lake, assuming little or no displacement on dated deposits on the west side of the valley. Uplifted lacustrine deposits representing Pliocene to middle Pleistocene highstands of Bear Lake on the footwall block of the east Bear Lake fault zone provide dramatic evidence of long-term slip. Slip rates during the late Pleistocene increased from north to south along the east Bear Lake fault zone, consistent with the tectonic geomorphology. In addition, slip rates on the southern section of the fault zone have apparently decreased over the past 50 k.y." ;

From 19.1 to 13.8 cal ka there is an absence of well-preserved diatoms because prolonged ice cover and increased turbidity from glacier-fed Bear River reduced light and limited diatom growth. The first well-preserved diatoms appear at 13.8 cal ka. Results of principal components analysis (PCA) of the fossil diatom assemblages from 13.8 cal ka to the present track changes related to fluctuations of river inputs and variations of lake levels. Diatom abundance data indicate that the hydrologic balance between 13.8 and 7.6 cal ka is strongly tied to river inputs, whereas after 7.6 cal ka the hydrologic balance is more influenced by changes in lake evaporation. Wet conditions maintained high river inputs from 13.8 to 10.8 cal ka and from 9.2 to 7.6 cal ka, with a dry interval between 10.8 and 9.2 cal ka. After 9.2 cal ka until 2.9 cal ka lake levels were high except for two periods, one between 7.6 and 5.8 cal ka and one between 4.3 and 3.8 cal ka, as a result of decreased effective moisture. After 2.9 cal ka, fossil diatom assemblages suggest drier conditions until 1.6 cal ka to the present, when fragments of large, pennate diatoms appear, possibly the result of a rapid lake transgression. Although similarities exist between the Bear Lake records and other western hydrologic and climatic records, the covariations are not strong. Our data suggest that climatic regimes at Bear Lake have changed frequently over time, perhaps as a consequence of the position of several important climatic boundaries near Bear Lake." ;

Varve-thickness measurements track summer temperature recorded at Atigun Pass, located 41 km east at a similar elevation (r (2) = 0.31, P = 0.08). Results indicate that climate in the Brooks Range from 10 to 730 AD (varve year) was warm with precipitation inferred to be higher than during the twentieth century. The varve-temperature relationship for this period was likely compromised and not used in our temperature reconstruction because the glacier was greatly reduced, or absent, exposing sub-glacial sediments to erosion from enhanced precipitation. Varve-inferred summer temperatures and precipitation decreased after 730 AD, averaging 0.4A degrees C above the last millennial average (LMA = 4.2A degrees C) from 730 to 850 AD, and 0.1A degrees C above the LMA from 850 to 980 AD. Cooling culminated between 980 and 1030 AD with temperatures 0.7A degrees C below the LMA. Varve-inferred summer temperatures increased between 1030 and 1620 AD to the LMA, though the period between 1260 and 1350 AD was 0.2A degrees C below the LMA. Although there is no equivalent to the European Medieval Warm Period in the Blue Lake record, two warm intervals occurred from 1350 to 1450 AD and 1500 to 1620 AD (0.4 and 0.3A degrees C above the LMA, respectively). During the Little Ice Age (LIA; 1620 to 1880 AD), inferred summer temperature averaged 0.2A degrees C below the LMA. After 1880 AD, inferred summer temperature increased to 0.8A degrees C above the LMA, glaciers retreated, but aridity persisted based on a number of regional paleoclimate records. Despite warming and glacial retreat, varve thicknesses have not achieved pre-730 AD levels. This reflects limited sediment availability and transport due to a less extensive retreat compared to the first millennium, and continued relative aridity. Overall, the Blue Lake record is similar to varve records from the eastern Canadian Arctic that document a cool LIA and twentieth century warming. However, the occurrence and timing of events, such as the LIA and Medieval Warm Period, varies considerably among records, suggesting heterogeneous climatic patterns across the North American Arctic." ;

This study used mass balances to compare wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and upstream sources of 16 CECs to a mixed-use watershed in Minnesota, under different seasonal and hydrological conditions. Three distinct CEC groups emerged with respect to their source proportionality and instream behavior. Agricultural herbicides and daidzein inputs were primarily via upstream routes with the greatest loadings and concentrations during high flows. Trimethoprim, mecoprop, nonprescription pharmaceuticals, and personal care products entered the system via balanced/mixed pathways with peak loadings and concentrations in high flows. Carbaryl, 4-nonylphenol, and the remaining prescription pharmaceuticals entered the system via WWTP effluent with relatively stable loadings across sampling events. Mass balance analysis based on multiple sampling events and sites facilitated CEC source comparisons and may therefore prove to be a powerful tool for apportioning sources and exploring mitigation strategies." ;

The Bear River was partly diverted into the lake in the early twentieth century so that Bear Lake could serve as a reservoir to supply water for hydropower and irrigation downstream, which continues today. The northern Rocky Mountain region is within the belt of the strongest of the westerly winds that transport moisture during the winter and spring over coastal mountain ranges and into the Great Basin and Rocky Mountains. As a result of this dominant winter precipitation pattern, most of the water entering the lake is from snowmelt, but with net evaporation. The dominant solutes in the lake water are Ca2+, Mg2+, and HCO32, derived from Paleozoic carbonate rocks in the Bear River Range west of the lake. The lake is saturated with calcite, aragonite, and dolomite at all depths, and produces vast amounts of carbonate minerals. The chemistry of the lake has changed considerably over the past 100 years as a result of the diversion of Bear River. The net effect of the diversion was to dilute the lake water, especially the Mg2+ concentration.Bear Lake is oligotrophic and coprecipitation of phosphate with CaCO3 helps to keep productivity low. However, algal growth is colimited by nitrogen availability. Phytoplankton densities are low, with a mean summer chlorophyll a concentration of 0.4 mg L1. Phytoplankton are dominated by diatoms, but they have not been studied extensively (but see Moser and Kimball, this volume). Zooplankton densities usually are low (<10 L1) and highly seasonal, dominated by calanoid copepods and cladocera. Benthic invertebrate densities are extremely low; chironomid larvae are dominant at depths <30 m, and are partially replaced with ostracodes and oligochaetes in deeper water. The ostracode species in water depths >10 m are all endemic. Bear Lake has 13 species of fish, four of which are endemic." ;

Multivariate statistics were run on autecological information for 29 extant ostracode species collected in 63 aquatic ecosystems on the Yucatan Peninsula along a steep, increasing NWS precipitation gradient and across a large altitudinal range. Conductivity and water depth are the most important factors that shape ostracode communities. Transfer functions were developed and applied to fossil ostracode assemblages in a ~76-m sediment core (PI-6, ~85 ka) taken in 71 m of water from Lago Peten Itza, to infer past shifts in conductivity and water level. Results suggest climate was cold and wet during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Alternating dry and wet conditions characterized the deglacial. Early Holocene climate was warmer and wetter. The LGM was characterized by low ostracode species richness (4 spp.) and abundance (<940 valves g1), dominance of benthic over nektobenthic taxa, abundant Physocypria globula, conductivity as low as 190 S cm1, and clay-rich sediments with relatively high total organic carbon and low C/N ratios (<14), suggesting relatively deeper water at the core site associated with abundant precipitation. Greatest water depth at the core site during the LGM occurred late in the period and was ~50 m. The deglacial was characterized by drier conditions, higher ostracode species richness (6 spp.) and abundances up to 18,115 valves g1, dominance of nektobenthic species, and presence of shallow-water and littoral-zone indicators such as Heterocypris punctata and Strandesia intrepida, conductivity up to 550 S cm1, C/N ratios as high as 37, and gypsum deposition. Lowest inferred lake depth at the core site during the deglacial was ~20 m. The early Holocene was characterized by high numbers of ostracode remains, up to 25,500 valves g1, and the presence of L. opesta and P. globula. Cytheridella ilosvayi was absent from late Pleistocene sediments, suggesting it colonized northern Central America during the Holocene." ;

Model simulations were designed to investigate the combined influences of persistent disequilibrium, reddening, and equifinality on lake water and sediment (i.e., biogenic and endogenic carbonate mineral) oxygen isotope (18O) values and to provide a basis for quantitative, probabilistic climate reconstructions using lake sediment 18O records. Simulation results indicate that within closed-basin lakes changes in long-term (i.e., multi-decadal) precipitation amounts produce inconsistent responses in lake water and sediment 18O values that are strongly influenced by lake basin outseepage and morphometry. Simulations of variable initial conditions in which randomly generated monthly climate data (i.e., precipitation, temperature, and relative humidity) were used to force the model during the equilibration period (which precedes the application of instrumental climate data) demonstrate that Castor Lake and Scanlon Lake have a somewhat limited isotopic memory of 10 years. Additional tests conducted using a Monte Carlo ensemble (in which random climate data were used to force the model) combined with 18O analyses of water samples collected from 2003 to 2011 AD, indicate that within small, closed lakes in the Pacific Northwest NovemberFebruary precipitation is the strongest seasonal, climatic control on sediment oxygen-isotope values. Further, a Monte Carlo based reconstruction of 20 year average NovemberFebruary precipitation amounts strongly correlates (R2 = 0.66) to instrumental values from the 20th century (with all observed values falling within modeled 95% prediction limits), indicating that probabilistic, quantitative paleoclimate interpretations of lake sediment 18O records are attainable." ;

Present-day vegetation is aspen forest (Populus tremuloides) intermixed with species of higher (Picea, Abies) and lower (Artemisia, Quercus) elevations. Stratigraphic units 4-13 contain montane forest taxa found near the site today and several species that today generally live at lower elevations within (Abies concolor, Lycopus americanus) and outside Colorado (Najas flexilis). These data suggest near-modern climatic conditions, with slightly warmer summer and winter temperatures. This montane forest period was succeeded by a shorter treeless interval (Unit 14) representing colder and/or drier conditions. In units 15-16, conifer trees reoccur but deciduous and herb taxa are lacking, suggesting a return to warmer conditions, although cooler than during the earlier forest period. Comparison of these inferred paleoclimatic changes with the site's geochronologic framework indicates that the lower interval of sustained warmth correlates with late MIS 6-early 5b (~ 138-94 ka), the cold interval with MIS 5b (~ 94-87 ka), and the uppermost cool assemblages with MIS 5a (~ 87-77 ka)." ;

The rapid sedimentation rate over the past 2 ka (ca. 4 m ka-1) provides a high-resolution archive of late Holocene environmental change. Physical and chemical environmental proxies extracted from cores from the Haukadalsvatn sediment fill provide a reconstruction of sub-decadal-scale climate variability in Iceland over the past 2 ka. Over this interval biogenic silica (BSi) reflects warm April-May temperatures, whereas total organic carbon (TOC) peaks represent an increased flux of carbon to the lake from eolian-derived soil erosion following periods of cold summers accompanied by dry, windy winters. The proxy-based temperature reconstructions show a broad interval of warmth through Medieval times, but this warmth is punctuated by multi-decadal cold intervals. The transition into the Little Ice Age occurred in two steps, with initial summer cooling 1250-1300 AD, and a more severe drop in summer temperatures between 1450 and 1500 AD; both are periods of severe explosive volcanism. Multi-decadal patterns of cold and warm conditions have some characteristics of a North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)-like signal, but instrumental records and proxy-based reconstructions of the NAO index contain little power in the frequencies most strongly expressed in our data set. Although severe soil erosion in Iceland is frequently equated with settlement, our reconstructions indicate that soil erosion began several centuries before settlement, whereas for several centuries after settlement, when summer temperatures were relatively high, there was little or no soil erosion. Only during the transition into and during the Little Ice Age did soil erosion become a major feature of the record.  2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

The core was collected in Barombi Mbo, an explosion crater lake formed probably during the Quaternary. The finely laminated sediment are composed mostly of dark brown to green clay rich organic matter (5-10% organic carbon). Each couplet is commonly composed of a lower unit rich in quartz, plant debris, muscovite and sponge spicules, and of a more clayey upper unit often with siderite (FeCO3) crystals. The average periodicity for one couplet is between 6 and 20 radiocarbon years. The pollen results, which are compared with those of another forested site in Ghana, demonstrate the presence of a forest refuge in West Cameroon during the last major arid period, about 18 000 years BP. At the same time that equatorial forest was broken up, elements of montain vegetation descended to the lowlands. To provide an explanation for these phenomena marked by a drying and cooling of the climate, modern examples of extensions of montain biotopes to low altitude are described. These localized extensions are due to the persistence of cloud cover, often of stratiform type, generated over the relatively cold water of ocean upwellings. Such lowering of sea-surface temperature might be the primary regional cause of the changes of climate and vegetation that occurred in humid tropical Africa. The upwelling, presently synchronous throughout the Guinea Gulf, amplify the trade winds, which could account for the observed changes inland.  1991." ;

The limnological characteristics of this karstic lake, including its meromictic nature, relatively high surface area/depth ratio (surface area ~0. 1 km2; zmax = 30 m), and steep margins, facilitated deposition and preservation of finely laminated facies, punctuated by clastic layers corresponding to turbidite events. The robust age model is based on 17 AMS 14C dates. Slope instability caused large gravitational deposits during the middle Holocene, prior to 6 ka BP, and in the late Holocene, prior to 1,600 and 1,000 cal yr BP). Relatively shallower lake conditions prevailed during the middle Holocene (6,000-3,500 cal years BP). Afterwards, deeper environments dominated, with deposition of varves containing preserved calcite laminae. Increased carbonate production and lower clastic input occurred during the Iberian-Roman Period, the Little Ice Age, and the twentieth century. Although modulated by climate variability, changes in sediment delivery to the lake reflect modifications of agricultural practices and population pressure in the watershed. Two episodes of higher clastic input to the lake have been identified: 1) 690-1460 AD, coinciding with an increase in farming activity in the area and the Medieval Climate Anomaly, and 2) 1770-1950 AD, including the last phase of the Little Ice Age and the maximum human occupation in late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

It is therefore important to understand the duration of such events, as well as their severity and consequences beyond the century-scale instrumental record. The existing drought records can be complemented with additional proxies that clearly document the interactions between external factors and the depositional environment. Here we attempt to reconstruct the last millennium drought history of Deming Lake, a small lake at Minnesota's prairieforest ecotone, using sediment magnetism. In particular, this approach allowed us to explore the interactions between lake and catchment, and test the hypothesis that periods of moderate aridity result in decreased hydrologic sediment transport from the catchment to the lake, as a consequence of reduced erosion and overland flow. Concordantly, during dry episodes we find that the mass fractions of in-lake produced organic matter and biogenic magnetic particles increase relative to allochthonous component fractions. We identify several episodes of aridity at Deming Lake consistent with existing regional drought reconstructions. The most prolonged dry event occurred at the end of the Little Ice Age, suggesting that the second half of this cold interval was drier in the region than previously thought." ;

This lake lies at a sensitive location between the dry climates of northern Mexico, under the influence of the North Pacific subtropical high-pressure cell and the moister climates of central Mexico, under the influence of the seasonal migration of the intertropical convergence zone and the North American monsoon (NAM). The sequence covers the last 2000 years and provides evidence of two periods of human impact in the catchment, shown by increases in the diatom Achnanthidium minutissimum. The first from AD 100 to 400 (Early Classic) is related to the shaft and chamber tombs cultural tradition in western Mexico, and the second is related to Post-Classic occupation from AD 1100 to 1300. Both periods correspond to relatively wet conditions. Three dry intervals are identified from increased carbonate and the presence of ostracodes and aerophilous Eolimna minima. The first, from AD 500 to 1000 (most intense during the late Classic, from AD 600 to 800), correlates with the end of the shaft and chamber tradition in western Mexico after ca. AD 600. This late Classic dry period is the most important climatic signal in the Mesoamerican region during the last 2000 years, and has been recorded at several sites from Yucatan to the Pacific coast. In the Yucatan area, this dry interval has been related with the demise of the Maya culture at the end of the Classic (AD 850 to 950). The last two dry events (AD 1400 to 1550 and 1690 to 1770) correspond with the onset of, and the late, Little Ice Age, and follow largely the Sporer and Maunder minima in solar radiation. The first of these intervals (AD 1400 to 1550) shows the most intense signal over western Mexico; however this pattern is different at other sites. Dry/wet intervals in the SMO record are related with lower/higher intensity of the NAM over this region, respectively." ;

High-resolution sub-bottom seismic profiles of Lago Cardiel indicate substantial lake-level changes since the late Pleistocene, which were identified and dated in a series of long piston cores. These data allow the reconstruction of the regional water balance at 49'S since the late glacial. The seismic stratigraphy reveals a dry late glacial climate with a desiccation of the basin around 11 220 yr BP (14C). Lake level rapidly increased by 135 m at the Holocene transition. Following the early Holocene highstand at + 55 m, lake level never dropped significantly below modern level. The palaeoclimate changes implied by the Lago Cardiel record are out-of-phase with those implied by records from tropical South America and demonstrate considerable latitudinal asynchroneity in the climate evolution of this continent." ;

We found that surface organic production fuels heterotrophic respiration at depth in advection-dominated peatlands, especially in fens. Fen DOC was 14C enriched relative to the surrounding fen peat, and fen respiration products were similar to this enriched DOC indicating that DOC was the main microbial substrate. Bog DOC was more variable showing either enrichment in 14C at depth or 14C values that follow peat values. This variability in bogs is probably controlled by the relative importance of vertical transport of labile carbon substrates within the peat profile versus DOC production from bog peat. These results extended our set of observations to 10 years at one bog-fen pair and add two additional bog-fen pairs to our series of observations. Anaerobic incubations of peat, rinsed free of residual DOC, produced DOC and respiration products that were strikingly similar to the peat values in a bog and two fens. This result demonstrated conclusively that downward advection is the process responsible for the presence of modern DOC found at depth in the peat column. Fen DOC has lower C/N values and up to twice as much LMW (<1 kDa) DOC as bogs due to differences in organic inputs and greater microbial processing. Fluorescence irradiation experiments showed that fen DOC is more photolabile than bog DOC." ;

Conductivity transfer functions applied to diatom records from the lake indicate generally higher conductivity during the Last Glacial Maximum and Lateglacial, especially between 15.0 and 10.5 ka. This observation is consistent with previous interpretations of relatively arid conditions during this interval based on the Lake Zeribar pollen records. Oscillations between high- and low-conductivity states during this interval additionally suggest changes in precipitation associated with millennial-scale climate events, with relatively dry conditions during the Younger Dryas. Diatom-inferred conductivity is relatively low throughout the Holocene. Shifts in diatom composition occur in the Holocene record; however, minor variations in reconstructed conductivity are not considered significant." ;

Our study used fossil ostracodes and a sedimentological record obtained from the August 2000 GLAD800 drilling operation at Great Salt Lake. We analyzed 125 samples, taken at 1 m intervals from Site 4 (GSL00-4), for ostracodes and other paleoecologic and sedimentologic indicators of environmental change. Multivariate analyses applied to the ostracode data and qualitative analyses of fossil and sedimentological data indicate an alternation between three major environments at the core site over the cored interval: (1) shallow saline or hypersaline lakes; (2) salt or freshwater marshes; and (3) occasional deep freshwater lakes. These environmental changes are consistent with shoreline studies of regional lake level fluctuations, but provide considerable new detail on both the timing and environmental conditions associated with the various lake phases. Our age model (using 14C, U-series, tephra and biostratigraphic chronologies) allowed us to associate the core's record of regional paleohydrology with the marine oxygen isotope stages of global climate change. The core contains continuous records for the last four glacial/interglacial sequences. Salt/freshwater marshes were common during the interglacials and deep freshwater conditions correspond with maximum global ice volume in OIS 2, and before a maximum in global ice during OIS 6. Immediately following deep lake phases, crashes in lake level from rapid desiccation resulted in the deposition of thick evaporite units. Our study suggests that the climate of the Great Salt Lake catchment appears to have been drier during OIS 6 than during OIS 2.We compare our record of environmental change during OIS 6 glaciation with other records from the western United States and find that the overall pattern of climate was similar throughout the West, but differences in the timing of climate change (i.e. when a region became drier or moister) are common." ;

Here biogeochemical analysis of a lake sediment core from southeast Greenland is used to define changes in moisture balance and runoff during the Holocene in a catchment near the margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet. A 1.6 m sediment core that spans the last 8.8 ka was recovered from Flower Valley Lake on Ammassalik Island. Magnetic susceptibility, diatoms, bulk biogeochemical properties (TOC, C/N, 13Corg), and lipid biomarkers (n-alkanes; C16C31) reveal changes in clastic sedimentation and the relative input of terrestrial- and aquatic-derived organic matter. Hydrogen isotope values (D) of mid- (n-C25) and long-chain (n-C29, n-C31) n-alkanes allow reconstruction of D of precipitation and summertime evaporation of lake water. Following a period of early lake ontogeny and landscape stabilization after deglaciation from 8.4 to 7.0 ka, the mid Holocene, 8.44.1 ka, is characterized by greater evaporative enrichment of the lake water as indicated by D records. After 4.1 ka, there is a decrease in evaporative enrichment of the lake water. There is also an abrupt transition to more variable sedimentation marked by sharp increases in magnetic susceptibility, C/N, 13Corg, and the concentration of long-chain n-alkanes, showing periodic delivery of terrestrial organic matter and clastic sediment to the lake. Higher insolation during the mid Holocene resulted in a warmer and drier climate with longer ice-free periods in the summer and enhanced evaporation of lake water. The reduction in insolation and colder temperatures during the late Holocene caused a reduction in evaporation of lake water over the last 4.1 ka and was accompanied by periodic increases in surface runoff, which correspond with intervals of cold Greenland Ice Sheet surface temperatures." ;

Paleoclimate inferences based on a wide variety of proxy indicators provide clear evidence for warmer-than-present conditions at 120 of these sites. At the 16 terrestrial sites where quantitative estimates have been obtained, local HTM temperatures (primarily summer estimates) were on average 1.60.8C higher than present (approximate average of the 20th century), but the warming was time-transgressive across the western Arctic. As the precession-driven summer insolation anomaly peaked 1210 ka (thousands of calendar years ago), warming was concentrated in northwest North America, while cool conditions lingered in the northeast. Alaska and northwest Canada experienced the HTM between ca 11 and 9 ka, about 4000 yr prior to the HTM in northeast Canada. The delayed warming in Quebec and Labrador was linked to the residual Laurentide Ice Sheet, which chilled the region through its impact on surface energy balance and ocean circulation. The lingering ice also attests to the inherent asymmetry of atmospheric and oceanic circulation that predisposes the region to glaciation and modulates the pattern of climatic change. The spatial asymmetry of warming during the HTM resembles the pattern of warming observed in the Arctic over the last several decades. Although the two warmings are described at different temporal scales, and the HTM was additionally affected by the residual Laurentide ice, the similarities suggest there might be a preferred mode of variability in the atmospheric circulation that generates a recurrent pattern of warming under positive radiative forcing. Unlike the HTM, however, future warming will not be counterbalanced by the cooling effect of a residual North American ice sheet." ;

We measured the concentration and isotopic composition of kerogen sulfur, chromium-reducible, and acid-volatile sulfides, as well as the abundance and partitioning of sedimentary phosphorus and iron, and the abundance and isotopic composition of organic carbon and nitrogen. Results indicate an approximately 150% increase in sulfur concentrations in sediments from Lake Edward over the past 200 years, during which time rainfall in the basin increased and the salinity of the lake fell. Increased sulfur concentrations are largely accounted for by increasing concentrations of kerogen sulfur, which is likely caused by environmentally-driven changes in organic matter quality and concentration, including increased anoxia and nutrient supply to the lake during wet intervals. The isotopic compositions of sedimentary sulfur pools support our interpretation that organic sulfur is derived primarily from sulfurization reactions in the sediment rather than primary bio-sulfur, and gradual isotopic enrichment of the 34S of sedimentary pyrite and kerogen sulfur could result from decreased lake salinity and sulfate availability during the past 200 years. These results highlight the importance of understanding environmentally-mediated changes in organic sulfur accumulation in interpreting the sulfur geochemistry of sediments and sedimentary rocks.  2009 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we examine the bulk and molecular geochemical records of two varved sediment cores from Lake Malawi, which together provide a continuous record of environmental variability in East Africa of the last 730 years. We observe a number of changes in the aquatic ecosystem of Lake Malawi, which are likely attributed to both natural climatic forcing and anthropogenic activities. Biomarkers of dinoflagellates (dinosterol) and bacterivorous ciliates (tetrahymanol) display increased accumulation rates from ~ 1900 AD to the present, while a simultaneous decrease in accumulation rates of diatom biomarkers (isololiolide/loliolide) is observed. Increased accumulation rates of retene, a compound derived from conifers, are also noted since ~ 1930 AD and likely reflect increased soil erosion due to deforestation of the Lake Malawi watershed. Spectral analysis of the high-resolution TOC record indicates a periodicity of 204 years, similar to the 206 year cycle noted in 14C and 10Be records, suggesting a link between East African climate and solar forcing." ;

In contrast to impoundments behind engineered dams, where silica (Si) fluxes may be changed by various aspects of dam construction, these two riverine lakes have long (9,000+ years) sedimentary sequences that record the entire span of cultural eutrophication and the resulting silica sequestration. The concentrations of dissolved silicate (DSi) and ASi in the lake inflows were measured for 1 year to obtain the total flux of bioavailable silica (TSi b = DSi + ASi) to each impoundment. Historical rates of Si sequestration in each lake were determined using ASi burial in multiple sediment cores and modeled estimates of historical TSi b fluxes. The Si trapping efficiency of each lake was found to have increased exponentially with cultural eutrophication (estimated two- to fivefold increase in Lake St. Croix and 9- to 16-fold increase in Lake Pepin over the last 100 years), indicating the degree to which eutrophication of impoundments can reduce silica export to downstream coastal and marine ecosystems. Because these two lakes presently exhibit different degrees of eutrophication, together they depict a relationship between phosphorus concentration and Si trapping efficiency that may be applied to other impoundments, including human-made reservoirs.  2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

Surface sediments of 46 globally distributed lakes were analyzed for GDGT, but isoprenoid GDGT derived from aquatic Crenarchaeota, were only unambiguously detected in 20 of the 46 lakes analyzed. Aquatic crenarchaeotal GDGT were detected mainly in sediments from large lakes (>4000 km2) and hydrothermal or volcanic lakes, suggesting that in some (mostly smaller) lakes either aquatic Crenarchaeota are present at low abundance resulting in sedimentary lipids below levels of detection, or they are absent. Branched GDGT, thought to be derived primarily from soil bacteria, were identified in all lake sediments analyzed. Correlation of the TEX86 in those lakes with sufficient amounts of putative crenarchaeotal GDGT with annual mean lake temperature is reasonably good (r2 = 0.68, N = 20). In order to reduce the influence of soil derived isoprenoid GDGT on the TEX86 lake temperatures, we have applied a filter based on relative soil derived inputs (as determined by the BIT [Branched and Isoprenoid Tetraether] index) which results in a calibration relationship with r2 = 0.86 (N = 12) and an estimated temperature error of 3.6 C. Our results suggest that the TEX86 should be applied only in lakes with sufficient production of GDGT by aquatic Crenarchaeota relative to isoprenoid GDGT derived from soil in the watershed or other aquatic sources.  2009 Elsevier Ltd.

These structures are interpreted as sediment mobilizations resulting from loading of the slope-adjacent lake floor during mass-flow deposition. More than 19 mass-flow deposits have been identified, combining results from 800 km of gridded seismic profiles used to site sediment cores. Successions of up to 6-m thick mass-flow deposits, pond atop the basin floor and spread eastward and westward following the main axis of the eastern sub-basin of Lago Fagnano. We developed an age model, on the basis of information from previous studies and from new AMS-14C ages on cored sediments, which allows us to establish a well-constrained chronologic mass-wasting event-catalogue covering the last 12 000 years. Simultaneously triggered, basin-wide lateral slope failure and the formation of multiple debris flow and postulated megaturbidite deposits are interpreted as the fingerprint of paleo-seismic activity along the Magallanes-Fagnano transform fault that runs along the entire lake basin. The slope failures and megaturbidites are interpreted as recording large earthquakes occurring along the transform fault since the early Holocene. The results from this study provide new data about the frequency and possible magnitude of Holocene earthquakes in Tierra del Fuego, which can be applied in the context of seismic hazard assessment in southernmost Patagonia." ;

This morphology-derived proxy information can be especially valuable when dealing with low-diversity fossil assemblages, i. e. in situations when paleoenvironmental inference based on species composition of the assemblage is less effective. We analyzed valve size and outline shape of the widespread and highly environmentally tolerant ostracode species Limnocythere inopinata collected in 15 lakes and ponds of Western Mongolia. We quantified shape variability among and within these living populations in relation to water chemistry and physical habitat variables. Our results indicate that: (1) a population's mean valve outline is related to habitat type, (2) surface water temperature, the alkalinity to sulphate ratio, specific conductance and total phosphorus together explain a high portion of the variance in mean valve outline between populations, and (3) a quantitative model inferring the alkalinity to sulphate ratio from mean valve outline has an R2 of 0.88 and RMSEP of 0.17. These results corroborate the hypothesis that high morphological variability in this ostracode species is due to both ecophenotypic variance and high clonal diversity associated with a mixed reproductive strategy (a combination of sexual and parthenogenetically reproducing lineages), and underline the value of morphometric techniques in paleoecology.  2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

The biogenic silica mass accumulation rate was low during the relatively dry late Pleistocene, when the river flux of silica to the lake was suppressed. Millennial-scale fluctuations, due to upwelling intensity, in the late Pleistocene climate of the Lake Malawi basin appear to have been closely linked to the Northern Hemisphere climate until 11 thousand years ago. Relatively cold conditions in the Northern Hemisphere coincided with more frequent north winds over the Malawi basin, perhaps resulting from a more southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone." ;

In this regard, an understanding of how the ice sheet responded to past climate changes affords a baseline for anticipating future behavior. Small, independent ice caps adjacent to the Greenland Ice Sheet (hereinafter called \" local ice caps\" ) are sensitive indicators of the response of Greenland ice-marginal zones to climate change. Therefore, we reconstructed late Holocene ice-marginal fluctuations of the local Istorvet ice cap in east Greenland, using radiocarbon dates of subfossil plants, 10Be dates of surface boulders, and analyses of sediment cores from both threshold and control lakes. During the last termination, the Istorvet ice cap had retreated close to its maximum Holocene position by ~11,730 cal yr BP. Radiocarbon dates of subfossil plants exposed by recent recession of the ice margin indicate that the Istorvet cap was smaller than at present from AD 200 to AD 1025. Sediments from a threshold lake show no glacial input until the ice cap advanced to within 365 m of its Holocene maximum position by ~AD 1150. Thereafter the ice cap remained at or close to this position until at least AD 1660. The timing of this, the most extensive of the Holocene, expansion is similar to that recorded at some glaciers in the Alps and in southern Alaska. However, in contrast to these other regions, the expansion in east Greenland at AD 1150 appears to have been very close to, if not at, a maximum Holocene value. Comparison of the Istorvet ice-cap fluctuations with Holocene glacier extents in Southern Hemisphere middle-to-high latitude locations on the Antarctic Peninsula and in the Andes and the Southern Alps suggests an out-of-phase relationship. If correct, this pattern supports the hypothesis that a bipolar see-saw of oceanic and/or atmospheric circulation during the Holocene produced asynchronous glacier response at some localities in the two polar hemispheres.  2012 Elsevier Ltd." ;

We used pollen and charcoal records from a lake and a testate amoebae-derived history of water-table depth in a nearby peatland to assess the response of the jack pine-dominated forests of northwestern Wisconsin to the climate variability of the last ~2000 years. The hydrology record and the charcoal record indicate that the climate near Warner Lake over the last ~2000 years was characterized by multidecadal variation in moisture availability with no apparent multicentennial-long trends in moisture balance or fire frequency. However, the pollen record suggests that there were multicentennial-scale changes in the vegetation composition around Warner Lake. Direct comparison of the three proxy records is challenging, because of their differing temporal resolutions and the complexity of potential ecological responses to climate variability. Therefore, we developed an interpretive model to compare multiple simulated proxies under two scenarios of environmental variability in order to determine under what conditions apparently contradictory records are likely to be found. The interpretive model reveals that a record of multicentennial-long change in vegetation is possible if multidecadal climate variability interacts with ecological processes influencing the direction and magnitude of succession. Compositional changes in the Warner Lake pollen record could reflect long-term variation in temperature, seasonality or other climate factors independent of moisture balance; however it is also possible that multidecadal moisture variability interacted with ecological processes affecting recruitment and mortality of species following fires of varying size and severity. Decadal-scale climatic variability can lead to altered successional pathways and to changes in forest composition that last for centuries." ;

First, that abrupt climate changes on the scale of centuries had little influence on long-term vegetation trends, and second, that abrupt climate changes interacted with slower climate trends to determine the regional sequence of vegetation phases. Our results support the second. Large dissimilarity between temporally close fossil pollen samples indicates large vegetation changes within 500 years across >4 of latitude at ca 13.25-12.75, 12.0-11.5, 10.5, 8.25, and 5.25 ka. The evidence of vegetation change coincides with independent isotopic and sedimentary indicators of rapid shifts in temperature and moisture balance. In several cases, abrupt changes reversed long-term vegetation trends, such as when spruce (Picea) and pine (Pinus) pollen percentages rapidly declined to the north and increased to the south at ca 13.25-12.75 and 8.25 ka respectively. Abrupt events accelerated other long-term trends, such as a regional increase in beech (Fagus) pollen percentages at 8.5-8.0 ka. The regional hemlock (Tsuga) decline at ca 5.25 ka is unique among the abrupt events, and may have been induced by high climatic variability (i.e., repeated severe droughts from 5.7 to 2.0 ka); autoregressive ecological and evolutionary processes could have maintained low hemlock abundance until ca 2.0 ka. Delayed increases in chestnut (Castanea) pollen abundance after 5.8 and 2.5 ka also illustrate the potential for multi-century climate variability to influence species' recruitment as well as mortality. Future climate changes will probably also rapidly initiate persistent vegetation change, particularly by acting as broad, regional-scale disturbances.  2009." ;

Additionally, the processes implicated in generating the 13CDIC values of individual lakes differ between lakes with similar 13CDIC compositions. Each lake thus initially appears idiosyncratic, but when the effects of carbonate mineral equilibria, microbial activity, and lake residence time are viewed in terms of the magnitude of distinct DIC pools and fluxes in stratified lakes, generalizations can be made that allow lakes to be grouped by 13CDIC behavior. We recognize three modes in the relationship between 13CDIC values and DIC concentration ([DIC]) of individual lakes: (A) 13CDIC values decreasing with increasing [DIC]; (B) 13CDIC values increasing with increasing [DIC]; (C) 13CDIC values decreasing with increasing [DIC] but increasing again at the highest [DIC]. This approach is useful both in understanding 13CDIC dynamics in modern hardwater lakes and in reconstructing the environmental changes recorded by sedimentary 13C components in the lacustrine paleorecord.  2006 Elsevier Inc.

The Brazilian Pantanal is a vast, seasonally inundated savanna floodplain system controlled by the flood pulse of the Upper Paraguay River. Little is known, however, about how floodplain lakes within the Pantanal act as sedimentary basins, or what influence hydroclimatic variables exert on limnogeological processes. This knowledge gap was addressed through an actualistic analysis of three large, shallow (<5 m) floodplain lakes in the western Pantanal: Lagoa Gaiva, Lagoa Mandiore and Baia Vermelha. The lakes are dilute (CO32- > Si4+ > Ca2+), mildly alkaline, freshwater systems, the chemistries and morphometrics of which evolve with seasonal flooding. Lake sills are bathymetric shoals marked by siliciclastic fans and marsh vegetation. Flows at the sills likely undergo seasonal reversals with the changing stage of the Upper Paraguay River. Deposition in deeper waters, typically encountered in proximity to margin-coincident topography, is dominated by reduced silty-clays with abundant siliceous microfossils and organic matter. Stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, plus hydrogen index measured on bulk organic matter, suggest that contributions from algae (including cyanobacteria) and other C3-vegetation dominate in these environments. The presence of lotic sponge spicules, together with patterns of terrigenous sand deposition and geochemical indicators of productivity, points to the importance of the flood pulse for sediment and nutrient delivery to the lakes. Flood-pulse plumes, waves and bioturbation likewise affect the continuity of sedimentation. Short-lived radioisotopes indicate rates of 0.11-0.24 cm year-1 at sites of uninterrupted deposition. A conceptual facies model, developed from insights gained from modern seasonal processes, can be used to predict limnogeological change when the lakes become isolated on the floodplain or during intervals associated with a strengthened flood pulse. Amplification of the seasonal cycle over longer time scales suggests carbonate, sandy lowstand fan and terrestrial organic matter deposition during arid periods, whereas deposition of lotic sponges, mixed aquatic organic matter, and highstand deltas characterizes wet intervals. The results hold substantial value for interpreting paleolimnological records from floodplain lakes linked to large tropical rivers with annual flooding cycles.  2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

Based on investigations of seismic facies and lithofacies, several key turbidity-flow depositional elements were observed, including channels, overbank levees with sediment waves, and depositional lobes. Analyses of the sources of the recent and ancient turbidite systems in these two extensional basins suggest that flood-induced hyperpycnal flows are important triggers of turbidity currents in lacustrine rift basins. From source to sink, sediment dispersal, facies distribution, and depositional thickness of the turbidite systems are strongly influenced by rift topography.

ns3:3b1bfbdc\-abb4\-3bc8\-b5d0\-07cb4bbc813d	ns2:abstracttext	"Biogeochemical cycles and sedimentary records in lakes are related to climate controls on hydrology and catchment processes. Changes in the isotopic composition of the diatom frustules (18Odiatom and 13Cdiatom) in lacustrine sediments can be used to reconstruct palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental changes. The Lago Chungara (Andean Altiplano, 1815S, 6910W, 4520 masl) diatomaceous laminated sediments are made up of white and green multiannual rhythmites. White laminae were formed during short-term diatom super-blooms, and are composed almost exclusively of large-sized Cyclostephanos andinus. These diatoms bloom during mixing events when recycled nutrients from the bottom waters are brought to the surface and/or when nutrients are introduced from the catchment during periods of strong runoff. Conversely, the green laminae are thought to have been deposited over several years and are composed of a mixture of diatoms (mainly smaller valves of C. andinus and Discostella stelligera) and organic matter. These green laminae reflect the lake's hydrological recovery from a status favouring the diatom super-blooms (white laminae) towards baseline conditions. 18Odiatom and 13Cdiatom from 11,990 to 11,530 cal years BP allow us to reconstruct shifts in the precipitation/evaporation ratio and changes in the lake water dissolved carbon concentration, respectively. 18Odiatom values indicate that white laminae formation occurred mainly during low lake level stages, whereas green laminae formation generally occurred during high lake level stages. The isotope and chronostratigraphical data together suggest that white laminae deposition is caused by extraordinary environmental events. El Nino-Southern Oscillation and changes in solar activity are the most likely climate forcing mechanisms that could trigger such events, favouring hydrological changes at interannual-to-decadal scale. This study demonstrates the potential for laminated lake sediments to document extreme pluriannual events." ;

This mid-continent forested bog complex is comprised of three major peat landforms, each of which was surveyed using ground penetrating radar (GPR), electrical resistivity, and induced polarization (IP): (1) a raised, ombrotrophic, wooded crest; (2) a sphagnum lawn down slope of the bog crest; (3) a spring fen water track where water flows across the peat surface around ovoid wooded islands. GPR was used to obtain peat thickness and to distinguish the peat stratigraphy as a function of variable water content between organic soil horizons. Resistivity data was collected to characterize the peat thickness and structure and to image the hydrogeologic framework beneath the organic soil. The results form a novel data set of a well studied bog complex, offering new insights into the peat structure and hydrogeologic framework. These observations have implications for general models of peatland development and carbon cycling." ;

Here we present results from new scientific drill cores from Lake Malawi, the first long and continuous, high-fidelity records of tropical climate change from the continent itself. Our record shows periods of severe aridity between 135 and 75 thousand years (kyr) ago, when the lake's water volume was reduced by at least 95%. Surprisingly, these intervals of pronounced tropical African aridity in the early late-Pleistocene were much more severe than the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the period previously recognized as one of the most arid of the Quaternary. From these cores and from records from Lakes Tanganyika (East Africa) and Bosumtwi (West Africa), we document a major rise in water levels and a shift to more humid conditions over much of tropical Africa after approximately 70 kyr ago. This transition to wetter, more stable conditions coincides with diminished orbital eccentricity, and a reduction in precession-dominated climatic extremes. The observed climate mode switch to decreased environmental variability is consistent with terrestrial and marine records from in and around tropical Africa, but our records provide evidence for dramatically wetter conditions after 70 kyr ago. Such climate change may have stimulated the expansion and migrations of early modern human populations." ;

ns3:3d0c9d83\-7417\-38a4\-bd5a\-3ab51ec00872	ns2:abstracttext	"Two high-sediment-accumulation-rate Icelandic lakes, the glacial lake Hvitarvatn and the non-glacial lake Haukadalsvatn, contain numerous tephra layers of known age, which together with high-resolution paleomagnetic secular variations allow synchronization with a well-dated marine core from the shelf north of Iceland. A composite standardized climate record from the two lakes provides a single time series that efficiently integrates multi-proxy data that reflect the evolution of summer temperatures through the Holocene. The first-order trends in biogenic silica (BSi), 13C, and C:N rise relatively abruptly following deglaciation, reaching maximum values shortly after 8 ka following a complex minimum between 8.7 and 8.0 ka. The Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) in the lakes is marked by all proxies, with a sharp transition out of the 8 ka cold event into peak summer warmth by 7.9 ka, and continuing warm with some fluctuations until 5.5 ka. Decreasing summer insolation after the HTM is reflected by incremental cooling, initially 5.5 ka, with subsequent cold perturbations recorded by all proxies 4.3 to 4.0 ka and 3.1 to 2.8 ka. The strongest disturbance occurred after 2 ka with initial summer cooling occurring between 1.4 and 1.0 ka, followed by a more severe drop in summer temperatures after 0.7 ka culminating between 0.5 and 0.2 ka. Following each late Holocene cold departure, BSi re-equilibrated at a lower value independent of the sediment accumulation rate. Some of the abrupt shifts may be related to Icelandic volcanism influencing catchment stability, but the lack of a full recovery to pre-existing values after the perturbation suggests increased periglacial activity, decreased vegetation cover, and glacier growth in the highlands of Iceland. The similarity in timing, direction and magnitude of our multi-proxy records from glacial and non-glacial lakes, and from the adjacent marine shelf, suggests that our composite record reflects large-scale shifts in ocean/atmosphere circulation throughout the northern North Atlantic." ;

A sediment core from Lake El'gygytgyn in northeastern (NE) Russia provides a continuous, high-resolution record from the Arctic, spanning the past 2.8 million years. This core reveals numerous \"super interglacials\" during the Quaternary; for marine benthic isotope stages (MIS) 11c and 31, maximum summer temperatures and annual precipitation values are ~4 to 5C and ~300 millimeters higher than those of MIS 1 and 5e. Climate simulations show that these extreme warm conditions are difficult to explain with greenhouse gas and astronomical forcing alone, implying the importance of amplifying feedbacks and far field influences. The timing of Arctic warming relative to West Antarctic Ice Sheet retreats implies strong interhemispheric climate connectivity." ;

The differences in apparent age between TOC, pollen, and carbonate fractions are consistent and in accord with the origins of these fractions. Comparisons among different fractions indicate that pollen sample ages are the most reliable, at least for the past 15,000 years. The post-glacial radiocarbon data also agree with ages independently estimated from aspartic acid racemization in ostracodes. Ages in the red, siliclastic unit, inferred to be of last glacial age, appear to be several thousand years too old, probably because of a high proportion of reworked, refractory organic carbon in the pollen samples.Age-depth models for five piston cores and the Bear Lake drill core (BL00-1) were constructed by using two methods: quadratic equations and smooth cubic-spline fits. The two types of age models differ only in detail for individual cores, and each approach has its own advantages. Specific lithological horizons were dated in several cores and correlated among them, producing robust average ages for these horizons. The age of the correlated horizons in the red, siliclastic unit can be estimated from the age model for BL00-1, which is controlled by ages above and below the red, siliclastic unit. These ages were then transferred to the correlative horizons in the shorter piston cores, providing control for the sections of the age models in those cores in the red, siliclastic unit.These age models are the backbone for reconstructions of past environmental conditions in Bear Lake. In general, sedimentation rates in Bear Lake have been quite uniform, mostly between 0.3 and 0.8 mm yr1 in the Holocene, and close to 0.5 mm yr1 for the longer sedimentary record in the drill core from the deepest part of the lake." ;

Fallen Leaf Lake, Cascade Lake, and Emerald Bay are three subbasins of the Lake Tahoe Basin, located south of Lake Tahoe, and provide an opportunity to image primary earthquake deformation along the WTDPF and associated landslide deposits. Here we present results from high-resolution seismic Chirp (compressed high intensity radar pulse) surveys in Fallen Leaf Lake and Cascade Lake, multibeam bathymetry coverage of Fallen Leaf Lake, onshore Lidar (light detection and ranging) data for the southern Lake Tahoe Basin, and radiocarbon dates from piston cores in Fallen Leaf Lake and Emerald Bay. Slide deposits imaged beneath Fallen Leaf Lake appear to be synchronous with slides in Lake Tahoe, Emerald Bay, and Cascade Lake. The temporal correlation of slides between multiple basins suggests triggering by earthquakes on the WTDPF system. If this correlation is correct, we postulate a recurrence interval of ~3-4 k.y. for large earthquakes on the Fallen Leaf Lake segment of the WTDPF, and the time since the most recent event (~4.5 k.y. ago) exceeds this recurrence time. In addition, Chirp data beneath Cascade Lake image strands of the WTDPF offsetting the lake fl oor as much as ~7.5 m. The Cascade Lake data combined with onshore Lidar allow us to map the WTDPF continuously between Fallen Leaf Lake and Cascade Lake. This improved mapping of the WTDPF reveals the fault geometry and architecture south of Lake Tahoe and improves the geohazard assessment of the region.  2013 Geological Society of America." ;

To better understand the basinwide glaciolacustrine response to late Holocene climate variability, we collected five cores from two areas in the lake, including a previously unexamined deepwater area distal from inlet streams. Based on eight AMS 14 C dates, and correlations among our cores and previously documented outcrops, we describe ~1,000 years of stratigraphy from each area. Deposition at both areas was dominated by fine-grained varves, but cores from the distal area uniquely contain coarser deposits, including rhythmites and graded sand beds, that we attribute to deposition of a subaqueous outwash fan-delta between ~1250 and 1650 AD. We attribute this event to thickening of the impounding glacier and consequent incursion of the glacier margin, and an associated lateral moraine, into the lake. This result suggests an early onset of the Little Ice Age (LIA) glacial advance in this region. Changes in basinwide circulation and sedimentation associated with this event probably caused minor thickening of varves used previously to reconstruct summer temperatures, reducing sensitivity of that record to early LIA cooling. The basinwide impact of this event illustrates the potentially significant spatial and temporal variability of lacustrine sedimentary processes in dynamic glacial landscapes." ;

(2007). Cluster analysis of the data obtained from both cores yielded similar results, differentiating clearly between the four climate modes warm, peak warm, cold and dry, and cold and moist. In addition, two transitional phases were identified, representing the early stages of a cold phase and slightly colder conditions during a warm phase. The statistical approach can thus be used to resolve gradual changes in the sedimentary units as an indicator of available oxygen in the hypolimnion in greater detail. Based upon cluster analyses on core Lz1024, the published succession of climate modes in core PG1351, covering the last 250 ka, was modified and extended back to 350 ka.

Western Mongolia is dominated by grasslands but the fire history of this region is largely unknown. We reconstructed modern fire (48 lakes) and historical fires (9 lakes) using sediment charcoal. Modern fuel loads were estimated using a combination of clipped plots, satellite-based estimates of annual aboveground net primary productivity (NPP) and NPP modeled from annual temperature and precipitation. Loss-on-ignition and environmental magnetics of lake sediments were analyzed as proxies for climate. We found little evidence for modern or historical fire in the landscape, as charcoal was absent from the surface sediments of 34 of 48 lakes. Charcoal influxes were uniformly low, averaging from 0.002 to 0.028 mm2/cm2 per yr, over the past 1200 years at nine lakes, and the past 6000g\"5000 years at two of the lakes with longer sediment records. In the modern landscape, livestock grazing has eliminated most of the fuels necessary to carry a fire, as measured fuel loads (27.34.9 g/m2) were only 20% of aboveground annual NPP estimated using MODIS Imagery or modeled from climate data. The historical absence of fire may indicate a longer history of intensive grazing than sometimes assumed, and cultural prohibitions against burning may also play a role. Regional summary indicated a >50% decrease in charcoal influxes since AD 1600 at most sites which may be related to lower temperatures or greater aridity during the 'Little Ice Age'. Alternatively this decrease in charcoal influxes may reflect increases in livestock numbers or increased local concentrations because of restrictions on the movement of animals coincident with the establishment of Manchu rule in the late seventeenth century." ;

Such accumulations are interpreted as representing forest-floor litter washed into depressions from superglacial forest on stagnant ice. An example of a trash layer in Minnesota is described from Steel Lake, which contains not only macrofossils of Picea from the superglacial forest but also much older fragments representing forest overridden by the advancing ice. A modern analogue is on the surge moraines of the Klutlan glacier in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Trash layers have not been described from similar dead-ice landscapes in Europe, perhaps because tundra plants rather than forest invaded the stagnant ice and left little litter. The closest example is found in Poland, where a basal peat of Allerd age is interpreted as of superglacial origin. The trash layer in the Minnesota sites is abruptly overlain by many meters of typical Holocene fine organic sediment. At the same level the Picea pollen zone changes to the Pinus zone, marking a prominent climatic change at nearly the same date as the end of the Younger Dryas cool interval, which is registered especially in areas around the North Atlantic Ocean. In Minnesota, however, the Picea/Pinus transition is time-transgressive from southwest to northeast over about 2000 years, in synchrony with the retreat of the Laurentide ice sheet." ;

The paleohydrological reconstructions show fluctuating lake levels since the end of the Medieval Warm Period (ca. AD 1300) till the late 19th century and a more acute dry period during the late 19th century - early 20th century, after the end of the Little Ice Age. Human activities have played a significant role in Laguna Zonar hydrological changes since the late 19th century, when the outlet was drained, and particularly in the mid-20th century (till 1982) when the spring waters feeding the lake were diverted for human use. Two main periods of increased human activities in the watershed are recorded in the sediments. The first started with the Christian conquest and colonization of the Guadalquivir River Valley (13th century) particularly after the fall of the Granada Kingdom (15th century). The second one corresponds to the late 19th century when more land was dedicated to olive cultivation. Intensification of soil erosion occurred in the mid-20th century, after the introduction of farm machinery. The lake was declared a protected area in the early 1980s, when some agricultural practices were restricted, and conservation measures implemented. As a consequence, the lake level increased, and some littoral zones were submerged. Pollen indicators reflect this limnological change during the last few decades. Geochemical indicators show a relative decrease in soil erosion, but not changes in the amount of chemical fertilizers reaching the lake. This study provides an opportunity to evaluate the relative significance of human vs. climatic factors in lake hydrology and watershed changes during historical times. Paleolimnological reconstructions should be taken into account by natural resources agencies to better define lake management policies, and to assess the results of restoration policies.

A varve chronology supported by several AMS 14C dates allows study of the lake evolution at annual scale in response to human impact and climate changes. There are four climate phases within this period: i) gradual transition (2600-2500 yr ago, 650-550 BC) from a previous arid period; ii) the most humid interval during the Iberian-Early Roman Epoch (2500-2140 yr ago, 550-190 BC); iii) an arid interval during the Roman Empire Epoch (2140-1800 yr ago, 190 BC AD 150); and iv) a humid period synchronous with the decline of the Roman Empire (1800-1600 yr ago, AD 150-350). Varve thickness and geochemical proxies show a multi-decadal cyclicity similar to modern North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) (60, 20 years) and solar variability cycles (11 yr). The timing and the structure of this humid period is similar to that described in Eastern Mediterranean and northern European sites and supports the same large-scale climate control for northern latitudes and the Mediterranean region.  2008 University of Washington." ;

Because of positive feedbacks between jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) and fire, communities with few fire breaks should be more resilient to changing climatic conditions. Pollen and charcoal from lakesediment cores were used to reconstruct vegetation changes at 50- to 100-year intervals and forest fire history at decadal time scales for the past 2500 years. The presence of fire breaks affected both fire regimes and the response of vegetation to climatic changes. Areas with more fire breaks had smaller charcoal peaks and the vegetation was more responsive to climate changes. The vegetation in areas with few fire breaks was more resilient, maintaining higher amounts of jack pine and (or) red pine than the more protected sites. We interpret these findings as evidence that positive feedbacks between fire and jack pine forests stabilized vegetation at sites where fire breaks were absent, and that such sites may be relatively resilient to future climate changes, until jack pine is no longer able to regenerate under the regional climatic conditions." ;

The 18O, 13C, Sr/Ca, Mg/Ca and U/Ca composition of shells from the species Candona neglecta found in two piston cores constrains the paleohydrology of the lake from 8700 to 1000 calendar yr before present. These data, combined with robust chronologies based on 16 AMS 14C dates, suggest that the region went from a relatively moist climate in the early Holocene to a more arid climate in the late Holocene. Intense freshwater input, presumably glacial runoff, flowed into the lake from 8700 to 8300 cal yr BP as evident from the 18O and 13C values. From 8300 to 6900 cal yr BP 18O and Sr/Ca values indicate that the lake was relatively fresh and an open basin, and U/Ca values suggest that the lake was well-mixed with well-oxygenated bottom waters. There is a transition zone between 6900 and 4900 cal yr BP when 18O and Sr/Ca values rapidly increase and Mg/Ca and U/Ca values rapidly decrease. During this period the lake evolved from an open, freshwater, well-mixed lake to a closed, more saline, less well-mixed lake. For the remainder of the record 18O, Sr/Ca, Mg/Ca and U/Ca are relatively constant, implying conditions similar to modern conditions, although the slight increasing trend in Sr/Ca may suggest an increase in salinity over this period. The 13C values were approximately in equilibrium with atmospheric CO2 in the early part of the record but became relatively negative in the later part of the record. This indicates that the dominant mechanism controlling the isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon shifted from exchange with the atmosphere to variations in biological productivity.  2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Sediments consist of biogenic varves composed of calcite, organic matter and detrital laminae and turbidite layers. Calcite layer thickness and internal sub-layering indicate changes in water temperature and seasonality whereas the frequency of detrital layers reflects rainfall variability. Higher temperatures occurred in Lake Montcortes in AD 555-738, 825-875, 1010-1322 and 1874-present. Lower temperatures and prolonged winter conditions were recorded in AD 1446-1598, 1663-1711 and 1759-1819. Extreme and multiple precipitation events dominated in AD 571-593, 848-922, 987-1086, 1168-1196, 1217-1249, 1444-1457, 1728-1741 and 1840-1875, indicating complex hydrological variability in NE Spain since AD 463. The sedimentary record of Lake Montcortes reveals a short-term relation between rainfall variability and the detrital influx, pronounced during extended periods of reduced anthropogenic influences. In pre-industrial times, during warm climate episodes, population and land use increased in the area. After the onset of the industrialization, the relationship between climate and human activities decoupled and population dynamics and landscape modifications were therefore mostly determined by socio-economic factors.  2012 University of Washington." ;

East Africa is pivotal for qualifying this impact, specifically in addressing a hypothesis that this eruption caused a volcanic winter leading to a genetic bottleneck in anatomically modern human populations. If the Toba eruption caused a volcanic winter in East Africa, effects should be recorded in sediments from climatologically sensitive ecosystems. In deep tropical lakes, cooler temperatures would have reduced the density contrast between the epilimnion and hypolimnion, causing increased mixing, hypolimnion oxygenation, and enhanced nutrient advection. Such environmental changes produce noticeable and predictable responses in lake fossil assemblages and sediment loading. Here we present the first paleoecological evidence from East Africa of environmental conditions surrounding the eruption in a high-resolution (~8-9 yr) analysis of two cores collected by the Lake Malawi Drilling Project. These cores contain an undisturbed record of sedimentation before, during, and after deposition of the youngest Toba Tuff. Concentrations of climate-sensitive ecological indicators such as phantom midges, diatoms, and other algae through a >270 yr interval bracketing the Toba cryptotephra show no unusual or sustained deviations from background variability within Lake Malawi associated with the hypothesized post-Toba cooling. We find no evidence for significantly enhanced mixing or ecosystem disturbance that would be anticipated following a volcanic winter." ;

The lack of long, continuous paleo-records prevents an examination of terrestrial responses to climate change with sufficient detail to answer questions about how systems behaved in the past and may alter in the future. We use high-resolution records of pollen, clay mineralogy, and particle size from a drill core from Lake Malawi, southeast Africa, to examine atmosphere-biosphere-geosphere interactions during the last deglaciation (189 ka), a period of dramatic temperature and hydrologic changes. The results demonstrate that climatic controls on Lake Malawi vegetation are critically important to weathering processes and erosion patterns during the deglaciation. At 18 ka, afromontane forests dominated but were progressively replaced by tropical seasonal forest, as summer rainfall increased. Despite indication of decreased rainfall, drought-intolerant forest persisted through the Younger Dryas (YD) resulting from a shorter dry season. Following the YD, an intensified summer monsoon and increased rainfall seasonality were coeval with forest decline and expansion of drought-tolerant miombo woodland. Clay minerals closely track the vegetation record, with high ratios of kaolinite to smectite (K/S) indicating heavy leaching when forest predominates, despite variable rainfall. In the early Holocene, when rainfall and temperature increased (effective moisture remained low), open woodlands expansion resulted in decreased K/S, suggesting a reduction in chemical weathering intensity. Terrigenous sediment mass accumulation rates also increased, suggesting critical linkages among open vegetation and erosion during intervals of enhanced summer rainfall. This study shows a strong, direct influence of vegetation composition on weathering intensity in the tropics. As climate change will likely impact this interplay between the biosphere and geosphere, tropical landscape change could lead to deleterious effects on soil and water quality in regions with little infrastructure for mitigation." ;

To do so, we focus on the \"Big Woods\" of central Minnesota, USA, which was shaped both by climate and fire. The deciduous Big Woods forest replaced regional woodlands and savannas after the severity of regional fire regimes declined at ca. AD 1300. A trend toward wet conditions has long been assumed to explain the forest expansion, but we show that water levels at two lakes within the region (Wolsfeld Lake and Bufflehead Pond) were low when open woodlands were transformed into the Big Woods. Water levels were high instead at ca. 2240-795 BC when regional fire regimes were most severe. Based on the correlation between water levels and fireregime severity, we infer that prolonged or repeated droughts after ca. AD 1265 reduced the biomass and connectivity of fine fuels (grasses) within the woodlands. As a result, regional fire severity declined and allowed tree populations to expand. Tree-ring data from the region show a peak in the recruitment of key Big Woods tree species during the AD 1930s drought and suggest that low regional moisture balance need not have been a limiting factor for forest expansion. The regional history, thus, demonstrates the types of counterintuitive ecosystem changes that may arise as climate changes in the future.  2009 by the Ecological Society of America." ;

Four distinct climatic phases bounded by sudden transitions are inferred: (1) variably dry 11,400-10,000 yr B.P., (2) humid 10,000-7200 yr B.P., (3) more seasonal 7200-2200 yr B.P., and (4) more arid 2200-0 yr B.P., with a dry \"Little Ice Age\" event 600-200 yr B.P. The diatom-inferred paleoclimatic history for northern Lake Victoria closely resembles that inferred from a well-dated pollen record from Pilkington Bay. Spectral analysis of the diatom record reveals strong periodicities including globally distributed 2360-2550, 1400, 1030-1130, and 500 cal-yr cycles. Repeated, rapid shifts between Aulacoseira- and Nitzschia-dominated diatom assemblages suggest that post-1960 changes in the lake's phytoplankton communities have had earlier, climate-driven analogs.  1997 University of Washington." ;

Radiocarbon dating and varve counts from a 7-m piston core constrain periods of major siderite accumulation to sediments older than 1200calyr BP. Sediment petrography suggests that siderite was a seasonal precipitate confined to the summer layer of the varve couplet. Bulk-sediment chemistry reveals cycles in abundance of manganese and aluminum coincident with centennial-scale cycles of siderite accumulation. Siderite 13C and 18O are enriched when the mineral is abundant and depleted when it is least abundant. Samples with high abundance of siderite precipitated in oxygen isotopic equilibrium with modern lake water, but are 13C enriched relative to modern waters. Samples from intervals of low siderite abundance are 13C and 18O depleted relative to equilibrium with modern lake water. These data suggest that abundant siderite precipitation occurred when the OL water column was ferruginous (iron meromictic), allowing for enhanced ferrous iron concentrations and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) enriched in 13C below the chemocline, where methanogenesis in waters and sediments influenced DIC composition. Seasonal siderite precipitation was triggered by water column alkalinity fluctuations driven by summer calcite dissolution. Manganese substitution in siderite lowered kinetic barriers to low-temperature mineral precipitation. Climate changes and basin filling influenced lake stratification and the rate of siderite precipitation. The siderite occurrence reported here displays remarkable similarity to its occurrence in Paleogene maar lake deposits, suggesting that further studies of Holocene lacustrine siderites may provide insight into ancient sedimentary systems and environments." ;

The upper (Ia) is well-stratified, while the lower is acoustically more massive and discontinuous. The sediments are intercalated with frequent mass movement deposits mainly in the proximal areas, while the distal region is almost free of such deposits at least in the upper part. In spring 2009, a long core drilled in the lake center within the framework of the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) penetrated the entire lacustrine sediment succession down to 320 m below lake floor and about 200 m farther into the meteorite-impact-related bedrock. Downhole logging data down to 390 m below lake floor show that the bedrock and the lacustrine part differ significantly in their petrophysical characteristics. The contact between the bedrock and the lacustrine sediments is not abrupt, but rather transitional with a variable mixture of impact-altered bedrock clasts in a lacustrine matrix. Physical and chemical proxies measured on the cores can be used to divide the lacustrine part into five different statistical clusters. These can be plotted in a redox-condition vs. input-type diagram, with total organic carbon content and magnetic susceptibility values indicating anoxic or oxic conditions and with the Si/Ti ratio representing more clastic or more biogenic input. Plotting the clusters in this diagram allows identifying clusters that represent glacial phases (cluster I), super interglacials (cluster II), and interglacial phases (clusters III and IV).

Shifts in temperature and precipitation can cause significant changes to glacier size and terminus position, the production and delivery of organic mass, and in the hydrologic energy related to the transport of water and sediment through proglacial environments. A sediment core representing a 12,900-yr record collected from Swiftcurrent Lake, located on the eastern side of Glacier National Park, Montana, was analyzed to assess variability in Holocene and latest Pleistocene environment. The spectral signature of total organic carbon content (%TOC) since ~ 7.6 ka matches that of solar forcing over 70-500 yr timescales. Periodic inputs of dolomite to the lake reflect an increased footprint of Grinnell Glacier, and occur during periods when sediment sinks are reduced, glacial erosion is increased, and hydrologic energy is increased. Grain size, carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios, and %TOC broadly define the termination of the Younger Dryas chronozone at Swiftcurrent Lake, as well as major Holocene climate transitions. Variability in core parameters is linked to other records of temperature and aridity in the northern Rocky Mountains over the late Pleistocene and Holocene." ;

In tropical Africa, the relative proportion of vegetation utilizing the C3 vs. C4 photosynthetic pathway is mainly controlled by precipitation and thus past hydrological changes can be inferred from the vegetation record. In this study, biomarkers of terrestrial plants (lignin phenols and plant leaf wax carbon isotopes) are examined from a well-dated sedimentary record from Lake Malawi to provide a vegetation (aridity) record of the past 23 cal ka from southeast Africa. We suggest that the ratio of cinammyl to vanillyl (C/V) lignin phenols in Lake Malawi sediments mainly reflects inputs of C3 trees (woody tissue) vs. C4 grasses (non-woody tissue) and find that changes in the C/V ratio generally support variability noted in the n-alkane carbon isotope record. Together, these records provide evidence for increased C4 vegetation (grasses) surrounding Lake Malawi during Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the Younger Dryas, in the early Holocene, and from ~ 2 cal ka to the present, suggesting drier conditions at these times. Elevated inputs of C3 vegetation are noted in the intervals from ~ 17-13.6 cal ka and ~ 7.7-2 cal ka, indicating wet conditions in southeast Africa. A relationship is noted between the n-alkane average chain length (ACL) and temperature, with longer ACLs associated with higher temperatures. Higher n-alkane carbon preference index (CPI) values correlate with higher mass accumulation rates of biogenic silica and may result from periodic increased northerly winds over Lake Malawi, which enhance upwelling and diatom productivity while simultaneously increasing erosion and transport of plant leaf waxes to the lake. The molecular data produced in this study suggest that the carbon isotopic signature of bulk sediment (13CTOC) in Lake Malawi is primarily a reflection of terrestrial inputs (C3 vs. C4 vegetation) and may not mainly reflect changes in algal productivity, as previously thought.  2009." ;

Evidence for extensive anthropogenic burning of temperate closed-canopy forests prior to European settlement is geographically variable, and the factors responsible for this variability are not well resolved. We set out to explain the differences in the influence of prehistoric human-set fires in seasonally dry forest types in the Pacific Northwest, New Zealand, and northern Patagonia by comparing the fire traits of dominant taxa, postfire vegetation recovery, long-term climate trends, and human activities that may have motivated burning. Our analysis suggests that ecological and climatic factors explain much of the differences in how these mesic-dry forests responded to prehistoric anthropogenic burning. Understanding past human-environment interactions at regional scales is an important step for assessing the impact of biomass burning at all scales." ;

In the current study we provide details of the biome reconstruction method applied to the late Pliocene and Quaternary pollen records from Lake El'gygytgyn. All terrestrial pollen taxa identified in the spectra from Lake El'gygytgyn were assigned to major vegetation types (biomes), which today occur near the lake and in the broader region of eastern and northern Asia and, thus, could be potentially present in this region during the past. When applied to the pollen spectra from the middle Pleistocene to present, the method suggests (1) a predominance of tundra during the Holocene, (2) a short interval during the marine isotope stage (MIS) 5.5 interglacial distinguished by cold deciduous forest, and (3) long phases of taiga dominance during MIS 31 and, particularly, MIS 11.3. These two latter interglacials seem to be some of the longest and warmest intervals in the study region within the past million years. During the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene interval (i.e., 3.562-2.200 Ma), there is good correspondence between the millennial-scale vegetation changes documented in the Lake El'gygytgyn record and the alternation of cold and warm marine isotope stages, which reflect changes in the global ice volume and sea level. The biome reconstruction demonstrates changes in the regional vegetation from generally warmer/wetter environments of the earlier (i.e., Pliocene) interval towards colder/drier environments of the Pleistocene. The reconstruction indicates that the taxon-rich cool mixed and cool conifer forest biomes are mostly characteristic of the time prior to MIS G16, whereas the tundra biome becomes a prominent feature starting from MIS G6. These results consistently indicate that the study region supported significant tree populations during most of the interval prior to 2.730 Ma. The cold- and drought-tolerant steppe biome first appears in the reconstruction 3.298 Ma during the tundra-dominated MIS M2, whereas the tundra biome initially occurs between 3.379 and 3.378 Ma within MIS MG4. Prior to 2.800 Ma, several other cold stages during this generally warm Pliocene interval were characterized by the tundra biome.  Author(s) 2013. CC Attribution 3.0 License." ;

Typically Mg:Ca and total dissolved solids (TDS) correlate positively over a broad range of ionic compositions where calcium carbonate precipitation occurs. However, in groundwater-fed lakes where inflow solutes are dominated by HCO3, Ca2+, and Mg2+ ions, and concentration of conservative solutes is limited by outflow, CaCO3 formation and depletion of major source-water ions results in a negative correlation between Mg:Ca and TDS at low lake salinity. This relationship is promoted by high pCO2 of inflowing groundwater, a common characteristic of groundwater-fed lakes such as our field example, a groundwater flow-through lake in western Montana, United States. Equilibrium modeling of our field example shows that evaporative evolution is expected to reverse the slope of the Mg:Ca/TDS relationship at moderately higher lake concentration. Generally, the TDS at the point of Mg:Ca/TDS reversal will depend on the initial concentration of less-reactive ions, and so on the source lithology for groundwater solutes." ;

Sedimentological analysis is supported by tephrostratigraphy to confirm the continuous, annual nature of the laminae, and a master varve chronology places proxies from multiple lake cores in a secure geochronology. Varve thickness is controlled by the rate of glacial erosion and efficiency of subglacial discharge from the adjacent Langjokull ice cap. The continuous presence of glacially derived clastic varves in the sediment fill confirms that the ice cap has occupied the lake catchment for the duration of the record. Varve thickness, varve thickness variance, ice-rafted debris, total organic carbon (mass flux and bulk concentration), and C:N of sedimentary organic matter, reveal a dynamic late Holocene climate with abrupt and large-scale changes in ice-cap size and landscape stability. A first-order trend toward cooler summers and ice-cap expansion is punctuated by notable periods of rapid ice cap growth and/or landscape instability at ca 1000 BC, 600 BC, 550 AD and 1250 AD. The largest perturbation began ca 1250 AD, signaling the onset of the Little Ice Age and the termination of three centuries of relative warmth during Medieval times. Consistent deposition of ice-rafted debris in Hvitarvatn is restricted to the last 250 years, demonstrating that Langjokull only advanced into Hvitarvatn during the coldest centuries of the Little Ice Age, beginning in the mid eighteenth century. This advance represents the glacial maximum for at least the last 3 ka, and likely since regional deglaciation 10 ka. The multi-centennial response of biological proxies to the Hekla 3 tephra deposition illustrates the significant impact of large explosive eruptions on local environments, and catchment sensitivity to perturbations.  2011 Elsevier Ltd." ;

A time scale is based on ten AMS 14C dates and by tephra layers from Jorullo (AD 1759-1764) and Paricutin (AD 1943-1952) volcanoes. The multiproxy analyses presented in this study reveal abrupt changes in environmental and climatic conditions. The results are compared to the paleo-record from nearby Lake Patzcuaro. Dry conditions and low lake level are inferred in the late Pleistocene until ca. 15 cal kyr BP, followed by a slight but sustained increase in lake level, as well as a higher productivity, peaking at ca. 12.1 cal kyr BP. This interpretation is consistent with several regional climatic reconstructions in central Mexico, but it is in opposition to record from Lake Patzcuaro. A sediment hiatus bracketed between 12.1 and 7.2 cal kyr BP suggests a drop in lake level in response to a dry early Holocene. A deeper, more eutrophic and turbid lake is recorded after 7.2 cal kyr BP. Lake level at the coring site during the mid Holocene is considered the highest for the past 17 cal kyr BP. The emplacement of the La Magueyera lava flows (LMLF), dated by thermoluminiscence at 6560  950 year, may have reduced basin volume and contributed to the relative deepening of the lake after 7.2 cal kyr BP. The late Holocene (after 3.9 cal kyr BP) climate is characterized by high instability. Extensive erosion, lower lake levels, dry conditions and pulses of high sediment influx due to high rainfall are inferred for this time. Further decrease in lake level and increased erosion are recorded after ca. AD 1050, at the peak of Purepechas occupation (AD 1300-1521), and until the eighteenth century. Few lacustrine records extend back to the late Pleistocene-early Holocene in central Mexico; this paper contributes to the understanding of late Pleistocene-Holocene paleoclimates in this region.  2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

Because direct observations are temporally limited, reconstructions of past fluctuations from glaciers that undergo dynamic advance and/or retreat are valuable. We constructed a 300 yr, annually resolved record of surges and terminus fluctuations of Langjokull ice cap (central Iceland) using a novel combination of varve counting, multibeam bathymetry, seismic imagery, and multiple sediment cores from targeted sites in Hvitarvatn, a large proglacial lake. Langjokull achieved its maximum Neoglacial extent between ca. A.D. 1700 and ca. 1930, when two outlet glaciers, Nordurjokull and Sudurjokull, advanced into the lake and maintained active calving margins. Nordurjokull advanced into the basin ca. 1720, and remained at or near its maximum extension for most of the 19th century, whereas Sudurjokull underwent a quasi-periodic series of 8 surges between 1828 and 1930, with a recurrence interval of 14  4 yr. Each surge event resulted in fragmentation of the glacier terminus during advances of up to1.6 km that occurred in <2 yr. Collapse of the expanded ice, iceberg melting, and reestablishment of the ice front at a nearshore grounding line occurred within 1-3 yr of the surge. Surges converted glacier ice to runoff at ~10 the non-surging rate. Our precise estimates of the timing, duration, and magnitude of Sudurjokull surges provide ideal targets for the next generation of glacier surge models." ;

In most lakes, ostracode species distributions vary systematically with depth, but in Bear Lake, there is a distinct boundary in the abundances of cosmopolitan and endemic valves in surface sediments at ~7 m water depth. This boundary seems to coincide with the depth distribution of endemic fish, indicating a biological rather than environmental control on ostracode species distributions. The cosmopolitan versus endemic ostracode species distribution persisted through time in Bear Lake and in a neighboring wetland.The endemic ostracode fauna in Bear Lake implies a complex ecosystem that evolved in a hydrologically stable, but not invariant, environmental setting that was long lived. Long-lived (geologic time scale) hydrologic stability implies the lake persisted for hundreds of thousands of years despite climate variability that likely involved times when effective moisture and lake levels were lower than today. The hydrologic budget of the lake is dominated by snowpack meltwater, as it likely was during past climates. The fractured and karstic bedrock in the Bear Lake catchment sustains local stream flow through the dry summer and sustains stream and ground-water flow to the lake during dry years, buffering the lake hydrology from climate variability and providing a stable environment for the evolution of endemic species." ;

Almost 60 new AMS dates of various carbonate fractions indicate that large (150 m) ostracode carapaces yield the most accurate chronology for the sediment record due to the input of \"old\" fine-grained carbonate. Stratigraphic correlations among the cores by carbonate abundance and magnetic susceptibility profiles provide supporting evidence for the ostracode-based chronology. This chronology refines earlier estimates of sediment accumulation that impacts the recurrence interval of lamination deposition from one lamination every two years to one lamination per year in two north basin cores. The record of carbonate content within the north basin of the lake reflect its dilution with terrigenous sediments input from the Omo River but direct paleoclimatic interpretations are complicated by lateral migrations of the delta channels with changing lake levels. Time-series analysis of both individual cores and a combined carbonate profile show significant spectral peaks at 1000, 76, 32, 22, 18.6 and 11 yr. The latter three suggest an important link between the sediments accumulating in Lake Turkana and global cycles of climatic variability.  1994." ;

Records of hydroclimate expressed in compound specific D values from terrestrial leaf waxes and a TEX86 paleotemperature record support multiple stages of pronounced drying and cooling from 13.8 to 11.5ka and demonstrate the dynamic behavior of the low latitude tropics during the deglaciation. The vegetation response, illustrated by compound specific 13C values and fossil pollen records, was an expansion of C4 grassland when the region was cool and arid. These results advance our understanding of a spatially and temporally complex regional response to global climate forcing, suggesting weakening of the Indian Ocean monsoon at the end of the Pleistocene that coincides with a minor decrease in the rate of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and during a time of stepwise cooling in the northern high latitudes." ;

The regional atmospheric circulation patterns that accompanied these climatic changes, however, are unclear due to a paucity of continental paleoclimate records from tropical Africa extending into the last interglacial. We present a new 140-kyr record of the deuterium/hydrogen isotopic ratio of terrestrial leaf waxes (Dwax) from drill cores from Lake Malawi, southeast Africa, that spans this important climatic transition. Dwax shifts from highly variable and relatively D-depleted to more stable and D-enriched around 56 ka, contemporary with the onset of more humid conditions in the region. Moisture source and transport history dominate the Dwax signal at Lake Malawi, with local rainfall amount playing a secondary role for much of the paleorecord. Analysis of modern moisture sources for Lake Malawi suggests that D-depletion of waxes during the megadroughts may have been caused by an enhanced contribution of the drier, D-depleted air mass currently located in central southern Africa to the Lake Malawi catchment. This D-depleted air mass is associated with the descending limb of the Hadley cell, which implies significant changes in the Hadley circulation during the megadroughts and related changes in the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone over Africa. These findings demonstrate the ability of Dwax to serve as an atmospheric tracer when used in conjunction with additional proxy records for moisture balance, and elucidate potential mechanisms for pronounced hydrological change in southeast Africa during the late Pleistocene." ;

Toba, Sumatra, 75,000 y ago, which produced voluminous ash deposits found across much of the Indian Ocean, Indian Peninsula, and South China Sea. A major climatic downturn observed within the Greenland ice cores has been attributed to the cooling effects of the ash and aerosols ejected during the eruption of the Youngest Toba Tuff (YTT). These events coincided roughly with a hypothesized human genetic bottleneck, when the number of our species in Africa may have been reduced to near extinction. Some have speculated that the demise of early modern humans at that time was due in part to a dramatic climate shift triggered by the supereruption. Others have argued that environmental conditions would not have been so severe to have such an impact on our ancestors, and furthermore, that modern humans may have already expanded beyond Africa by this time. We report an observation of the YTT in Africa, recovered as a cryptotephra layer in Lake Malawi sediments, >7,000 km west of the source volcano. The YTT isochron provides an accurate and precise age estimate for the Lake Malawi paleoclimate record, which revises the chronology of past climatic events in East Africa. The YTT in Lake Malawi is not accompanied by a major change in sediment composition or evidence for substantial temperature change, implying that the eruption did not significantly impact the climate of East Africa and was not the cause of a human genetic bottleneck at that time." ;

The intersite comparisons are used to distinguish local variation in climate or hydrology from regional patterns of change. At one lake, diatom-inferred salinity and lake-water Mg/Ca inferred from ostracode shell chemistry are coherent, both in terms of direction and magnitude of change, indicating that each is a robust technique for reconstructing lake-water chemistry. The data show that the last 2000 yr have been characterized by frequent shifts between high and low salinity, suggesting shifts between dry and moist periods. Long intervals of high salinity suggest periods of multiple decades when droughts were intense and frequent, thus indicating times when drought was more persistent than in the 20th century. Both the Medieval Period and Little Ice Age were hydrologically complex, and there is no clear evidence to suggest that either interval was coherent or unusual in effective moisture relative to long-term patterns. Differences among the three sites may be attributed to variation in local hydrology, and these differences emphasize the need for multiple sites in deriving regional climate interpretations from paleoecological data.

ns3:491f8ccf\-1ba4\-352d\-aecd\-2fa0d9847bc8	ns2:abstracttext	"A 136-m-long drill core of sediments was recovered from tropical high-altitude Lake Titicaca, Bolivia-Peru, enabling a reconstruction of past climate that spans four cycles of regional glacial advance and retreat and that is estimated to extend continuously over the last 370,000 yr. Within the errors of the age model, the periods of regional glacial advance and retreat are concordant respectively with global glacial and interglacial stages. Periods of ice advance in the southern tropical Andes generally were periods of positive water balance, as evidenced by deeper and fresher conditions in Lake Titicaca. Conversely, reduced glaciation occurred during periods of negative water balance and shallow closed-basin conditions in the lake. The apparent coincidence of positive water balance of Lake Titicaca and glacial growth in the adjacent Andes with Northern Hemisphere ice sheet expansion implies that regional water balance and glacial mass balance are strongly influenced by global-scale temperature changes, as well as by precessional forcing of the South American summer monsoon.  2007 University of Washington." ;

Mineralogy, elemental geochemistry, and magnetic properties provide information about variations in provenance of allogenic lithic material in last-glacial-age, quartz-rich sediment in Bear Lake. Grain-size data from the silici-clastic fraction of late-glacial to Holocene carbonate-rich sediments provide information about variations in lake level. For the quartz-rich lower unit, which was deposited while the Bear River flowed into and out of the lake, four source areas are recognized on the basis of modern fluvial samples with contrasting properties that reflect differences in bedrock geology and in magnetite content from dust. One of these areas is underlain by hematite-rich Uinta Mountain Group rocks in the headwaters of the Bear River. Although Uinta Mountain Group rocks make up a small fraction of the catchment, hematite-rich material from this area is an important component of the lower unit. This material is interpreted to be glacial flour. Variations in the input of glacial flour are interpreted as having caused quasi-cyclical variations in mineralogical and elemental concentrations, and in magnetic properties within the lower unit. The carbonate-rich younger unit was deposited under conditions similar to those of the modern lake, with the Bear River largely bypassing the lake. For two cores taken in more than 30 m of water, median grain sizes in this unit range from ~6 m to more than 30 m, with the coarsest grain sizes associated with beach or shallow-water deposits. Similar grain-size variations are observed as a function of water depth in the modern lake and provide the basis for interpreting the core grain-size data in terms of lake level." ;

Variations in total organic carbon (TOC) and hydrogen content (expressed as Hydrogen Index, HI) can be related to known changes in lake level and used to identify periods of very low water or subaerial exposure in basinal sequences. TOC and HI both decline as an exposure surface is approached, mainly due to the selective removal of unstable components by bacterial respiration and inorganic oxidation. Inert organic material of very low HI is typically concentrated at the overlying transgression surface. The carbon isotopic composition of the particulate organic matter tends to be less negative in sediments associated with exposure surfaces. Although weathering may be partially responsible, isotopic variations are mainly due to changes in the relative importance of material from plants using C4 photosynthesis, such as grasses and sedges, growing around the shore and on the exposed lake muds, and of material from planktonic algae and terrestrial C3 plants.  1989." ;

This suite of records offers a unique view of the lapse rate in stable isotopes from the lower to upper troposphere. The region is climatologically important, being beside the Cordilleran pinning-point of the Rossby Wave system and the Aleutian Low. Comparison of stable isotope series over the last 2000 years and model simulations suggest sudden and persistent shifts between modern (mixed) and zonal flow regimes of water vapour transport to the Pacific Northwest. The last such shift was in A.D. 1840. Model simulations for modern and \"pure\" zonal flow suggest that these shifts are consistent regime changes between these flow types, with predominantly zonal flow prior to ca. A.D. 1840 and modern thereafter. The 5.4 and 0.8 km asl records show a shift at A.D. 1840 and another at A.D. 800. It is speculated that the A.D. 1840 regime shift coincided with the end of the Little Ice Age and the A.D. 800 shift with the beginning of the European Medieval Warm Period. The shifts are very abrupt, taking only a few years at most." ;

From AD 8001090 during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) SBB sediments were dominated by xeric vegetation types (drought-resistant coastal sagebrush and chaparral) implying reduced precipitation in the southern California region. Drought-adapted vegetation abruptly decreased at AD 1090 and was rapidly replaced by mesic oak (Quercus) woodlands associated with an increased pollen flux into the basin. After a mesic interval lasting 100 years, pollen flux and the relative abundance of Quercus pollen dropped abruptly at AD 1200 when the rapid rise of chaparral suggests a significant drought similar to that of the MCA (AD 8001090). This brief resurgence of drought-adapted vegetation between AD 12001270 marked the end of the MCA droughts. A gradual increase in mesic vegetation followed, characterizing cool hydroclimates of the Little Ice Age (LIA) in coastal southern California. The presence of xeric vegetation in SBB coincides with major drought events recorded in tree rings and low lake levels elsewhere in California except for the brief drought between AD 11301160. Correlative diatom and terrigenous sediment input proxy records from SBB are largely supportive of the pollen record predominantly linking the MCA with drought and La Nina-like conditions and the LIA with wetter (more El Nino-like) conditions. Differences between paleoclimate proxies (pollen, diatoms, and terrigenous sediment) in SBB exist, however, possibly reflecting the temporal and spatial differences in the generation of each proxy record, as well as their individual sensitivity to climate change." ;

We analyzed pollen assemblages, charcoal accumulation rates, and higher plant biomarker compounds (average chain length [ACL] of n-alkanes) in sediments from Wai'a napanapa, a small lake near the upper forest limit and the mean trade wind inversion (TWI) in Hawai'i. The paleorecord of ACL suggests increased drought frequency and a lower TWI elevation from 2555-1323 cal yr B.P. and 606-334 cal yr B.P. Charcoal began to accumulate and a novel fire regime was initiated ca. 880 cal yr B.P., followed by a decreased fire return interval at ca. 550 cal yr B.P. Diebacks occurred at 2931, 2161, 1162, and 306 cal yr B.P., and two of these were independent of drought or fire. Pollen assemblages indicate that on average species composition changed only 2.8% per decade. These dynamics, though slight, were significantly associated with disturbance. The direction of species composition change varied with disturbance type. Drought was associated with significantly more vines and lianas; fire was associated with an increase in the tree fern Sadleria and indicators of open, disturbed landscapes at the expense of epiphytic ferns; whereas stand-scale dieback was associated with an increase in the tree fern Cibotium. Though this cloud forest was dynamic in response to past disturbance, it has recovered, suggesting a resilient TMCF with no evidence of state change in vegetation type (e.g., grassland or shrubland)." ;

The purpose of this paper is to answer the question: is there evidence for periods of persistent drought in the vicinity of Zaca Lake, Santa Barbara County, California, and can the mechanisms which drive them be identified? In this study we use pollen, sediments, and hydrogen isotopes from leaf wax to generate a 3000 year record of vegetation and climate along the Southern California coast. We identify a multi-centennial scale drought between 2700 and 2000 cal yr BP in Zaca Lake, corroborating evidence from across the Great Basin and extending the regional spread of this multi-centennial drought to Southern California. Wetter conditions in the northwest during this period indicate that the modern ENSO precipitation dipole also occurred during this persistent drought. Today this dipole is associated with La Nina conditions and we note a coincidence with intriguing evidence for a change in ENSO dynamics from marine records in the tropical Pacific. This dry period is remarkably persistent and has important implications for understanding the possible durations of drought conditions in the past in California. In addition, we find evidence for 3 warm periods between 1350 and 650 cal yr BP which are identified in the record by the presence of the algae Pediastrum boryanum var. boryanum. The latter two of these periods, dating from 1070900 and 700650 cal yr BP correspond to droughts during the Medieval Climatic Anomaly identified in other records. A period of high Salix percentages and high pollen concentration from 500 to 250 cal yr BP represents the wettest period of the record and coincides with the Little Ice Age. An increase in Pinus and Quercus pollen found in the last 100 years of the record is a result of known planting and fire suppression by the forest service." ;

In this study we measured dissolved silica (DSi) and amorphous silica (ASi) fluxes into and out of two large, culturally-impacted natural impoundments of the upper Mississippi River, Lakes St. Croix and Pepin, USA. ASi sedimentation rates and sediment-water fluxes of DSi were calculated for each lake, and a mass-balance approach was used to determine in-lake ASi production. ASi from terrestrial phytoliths in the lake sediments was determined to be only partially available to biotic recycling, and in-lake ASi dissolution was small relative to the total silica budgets. The river reaches upstream of the two lakes were found to have abundant DSi, and riverine diatom production was found to contribute significant amounts of ASi to each lake. The average total phosphorus concentration in Lake Pepin is four times that in Lake St. Croix but ASi production in Lake Pepin is only 2.3 times higher than in Lake St. Croix, indicating that diatom growth in Pepin is limited by factors such as turbidity. Lake St. Croix currently traps about 10% of the inflowing total bioavailable silica (TSib = DSi + ASi) while Lake Pepin traps closer to 20% of its inflowing TSib, clearly demonstrating the importance of silica retention in lakes and reservoirs along the land-ocean continuum.  2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

The migration of both the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the Congo Air Boundary (CAB) constrains rainfall amount and duration for most of East Africa. Lake Turkana, in northern Kenya, is the world's largest desert lake and experiences two ITCZ-associated rainy seasons annually, with cumulative rainfall of ~200mm/yr. Evidence from new continuous, high-fidelity sediment core records and high-resolution CHIRP seismic reflection data suggests that Lake Turkana received enough rainfall during the African Humid Period (AHP) to fill the lake to its sill (100m above current lake level) and spilled over into the White Nile River system. An atmospheric configuration with an eastward-shifted CAB over the Turkana region and the northern Kenya Rift is invoked as an additional source of rainfall for the catchment. This configuration began abruptly at ~11ka and lasted until ~5ka when Lake Turkana became a closed basin and was cut off from the White Nile. Prior to the AHP, Lake Turkana experienced at least two desiccation events following the Last Glacial Maximum at 18.5 and 17ka when the lake was at least 100m lower than modern, as evidenced by basin-wide, high amplitude reflections and 14C-dated shallow water facies in sediment cores. Lake level fluctuations generally follow trends in mean solar insolation, however the onset of lake level extremes are much more abrupt than rates of insolation change. Lake Turkana's location in relation to atmospheric convergence and dynamic rainfall patterns makes its susceptible to extreme climate change over relatively short timescales.  2014 Elsevier B.V." ;

In the South Island of New Zealand, Polynesians (Maori), who arrived 700800 calibrated years (cal y) ago, and then Europeans, who settled 150 cal y ago, used fire as a tool for forest clearance, but the structure and environmental consequences of these fires are poorly understood. High-resolution charcoal and pollen records from 16 lakes were analyzed to reconstruct the fire and vegetation history of the last 1,000 y. Diatom, chironomid, and element concentration data were examined to identify disturbance-related limnobiotic and biogeochemical changes within burned watersheds. At most sites, several high-severity fire events occurred within the first two centuries of Maori arrival and were often accompanied by a transformation in vegetation, slope stability, and lake chemistry. Proxies of past climate suggest that human activity alone, rather than unusually dry or warm conditions, was responsible for this increased fire activity. The transformation of scrub to grassland by Europeans in the mid-19th century triggered further, sometimes severe, watershed change, through additional fires, erosion, and the introduction of nonnative plant species. Alteration of natural disturbance regimes had lasting impacts, primarily because native forests had little or no previous history of fire and little resilience to the severity of burning. Anthropogenic burning in New Zealand highlights the vulnerability of closed-canopy forests to novel disturbance regimes and suggests that similar settings may be less resilient to climate-induced changes in the future." ;

A preliminary chronological framework is presented, based on U/Th, 14C AMS, 210Pb and 137Cs analyses. The lacustrine-tufa system developed in a hanging tributary valley of the Upper Tajo River and is composed of a large perched springline tufa build-up, and a barrage tufa dam that impounds Laguna de Taravilla. The Taravilla tufa stable-isotope compositions are similar to other examples in central and southern Spain and they plot in the same field as other lowland European stream tufas. These values are coherent with the range of isotopic compositions measured in the Taravilla spring and lake water. Several sediment cores retrieved from the Laguna de Taravilla have been dated with 14C AMS and analyzed using a multiproxy approach including magnetic properties, sedimentology, geochemistry, stable isotopes, palynology and ostracode assemblages. Sedimentary facies analyses show the dominance of clastic depositional processes in the lacustrine depositional system and suggest the potential of the sequences as palaeoflood records. Sands and coarse silts reflect periods of increased alluvial activity of the inlet. The dominance of clastic depositional processes and the input of detrital carbonate hinder the use of lake mud stable-isotope compositions as environmental indicators. Phases of increased tufa growth occurred during the Late Pleistocene (Last Glacial to Interglacial transition from oxygen isotopic stage 6 to 5) and during the Late Glacial and Early Holocene. Although the Taravilla chronology does not allow a detailed analysis of flood frequency, the reconstructed evolution is coherent with the palaeoflood history of the Tajo River for the last 2000 years, particularly with an increase during the last 500 years. The increase in flood frequency coincides with other evidence of wetter and colder climate and environmental change in Central Spain and in Europe during the Little Ice Age.  2007 Elsevier B.V.

Linking climate change directly to societal disruption is challenging because socioeconomic factors also play a large role, with climate being secondary or sometimes inconsequential. Combining paleolimnologic, historical, and archaeological methods provides for a more secure basis for interpreting the past impacts of climate on society. We present pollen, non-pollen palynomorph, geochemical, paleomagnetic and sedimentary data from a high-resolution 2700 yr lake sediment core from central Italy and compare these data with local historical documents and archeological surveys to reconstruct a record of environmental change in relation to socioeconomic history and climatic fluctuations. Here we document cases in which environmental change is strongly linked to changes in local land management practices in the absence of clear climatic change, as well as examples when climate change appears to have been a strong catalyst that resulted in significant environmental change that impacted local communities. During the Imperial Roman period, despite a long period of stable, mild climate, and a large urban population in nearby Rome, our site shows only limited evidence for environmental degradation. Warm and mild climate during the Medieval Warm period, on the other hand, led to widespread deforestation and erosion. The ability of the Romans to utilize imported resources through an extensive trade network may have allowed for preservation of the environment near the Roman capital, whereas during medieval time, the need to rely on local resources led to environmental degradation. Cool wet climate during the Little Ice Age led to a breakdown in local land use practices, widespread land abandonment and rapid reforestation. Our results present a high-resolution regional case study that explores the effect of climate change on society for an under-documented region of Europe." ;

The model first simulates the historical lake-level record over the last 100 years using climate station and vegetation data as inputs. Atmospheric conditions required to sustain equilibrium water balance are then estimated at known critical lake-levels: modern (700 m maximum water depth), basin closure (696 m maximum water depth), 500 m, 350 m, 200 m, and 150 m maximum water depth. The critical low lake stages were determined from analysis of seismic-reflection and deep lake drill-core data. The model predicts modern precipitation rate to be 955 mm/yr, which is consistent with observed climate station precipitation records. The minimum lowstand observed in geophysical records is 150 m water depth (550 m below present lake-level), and occurred about 95,000 years before present. The precipitation rate required to sustain equilibrium conditions at this low lake stage is 557 mm/yr, assuming modern Lake Malawi temperature and vegetation, and 374 mm/yr using modern temperature and vegetation data from the Little Karoo Basin, an analogue for the Malawi paleo-environment during severe arid intervals that resulted in major lake lowstands. The latter result is consistent with the range of precipitation measured from the Little Karoo Basin (100 to 500 mm/yr), and from interpretations of drill-core data sets (Cohen et al., 2007). The time required to drop lake-level from its modern maximum to the most severe low lake stage determined from paleoclimate data sets (from 700 m to 150 m maximum water depth) is less than 2500 years, even when accounting for additional water volume loss stored as groundwater. A lake-level fall of this magnitude reduces the lake surface area by 94% and reduces the total lake volume by 99%." ;

However, the influence of these factors on algal communities over longer time scales remains unclear, yet is critical to paleolimnological interpretation of environmental change in alpine regions. We examined sedimentary algal pigments and fossil diatom assemblages in two proximal lakes with equivalent local climates, one glacier-fed and one snow-fed, in the central Rocky Mountains (USA) to determine how glacier meltwater has altered algal records over the last 3,000 years. Differences between the records of the two lakes intensified during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, with the glacier-fed lake exhibiting an overall increase in fossil algal pigment concentrations and greater diatom assemblage turnover. Starting 1,000 years ago, the glacier-fed lake in this study showed evidence of nitrogen enrichment from glacier meltwater, as indicated by increasing relative abundances of Asterionella formosa and, to a lesser extent, Fragilaria crotonensis. Since the Little Ice Age, diatom species richness declined in the glacier-fed lake, and further decreased following the 1950s, while assemblage turnover increased. These results demonstrate that glaciers can strongly alter the algal sedimentary record and should be considered when interpreting high-elevation lake records." ;

The project, called the Bighorn Basin Coring Project (BBCP), focuses on the early Paleogene (50-65 million years ago), the most recent interval of Earth history characterized by greenhouse climate conditions. During the early Paleogene, global mean annual temperatures were up to 10C higher than today, and carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentrations may have been more than 1000 parts per million [Zachos et al., 2008] compared with the roughly 390 parts per million today. Superimposed on this background greenhouse climate state were a series of short-term extreme warming events called hyperthermals. The best known early Paleogene hyperthermal event is the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; 56 million years ago), which is characterized by a large global carbon isotope excursion and coincides with major changes to marine and continental ecosystems [McInerney and Wing, 2011]. At present, the causes of these hyperthermal events remain unknown, although several hypotheses exist." ;

This paper presents a new sub-centennial record of Holocene vegetation, fire and sedimentological changes at Spicer Lake, IN, to test hypotheses about the role of fire and hydrological variations on shifts in vegetation composition. Four pollen zones are reported: AbiesPicea forests (1511.8 ka BP), Pinus-dominated mixed forest (11.810.6 ka BP), transitional mixed forest (10.66.8 ka BP), and deciduous forest characterized by the expansion and high variability of F. grandifolia (after 6.8 ka BP). Macroscopic charcoal indicates five to seven fires between 6.1 and 4.4 ka BP and no fires between 4.4 and 2 ka BP, despite several large declines in F. grandifolia, and more fires after 1.8 ka BP likely linked to declining F. grandifolia abundances after 1.1 ka BP. Six peaks in mineralogenic sediments are suggestive of hydroclimate variability, but do not consistently correspond to shifts in F. grandifolia abundances. A Bayesian change-point analysis of 15 regional F. grandifolia pollen records identifies peak probabilities of events at 4.8 and 1.1 ka BP, similar in timing to variations in T. canadensis at other sites. Hence, fire can be ruled out as a driver of the mid-Holocene declines of F. grandifolia, but more work is needed to confidently establish the regional timing of F. grandifolia declines and to link them to past droughts and T. canadensis declines in eastern North America." ;

Here we report a detailed record of changes in moisture availability during the latter part of this transition (  11 250 to 7500 cal. yr BP) inferred from sediment cores retrieved in Lake Peten Itza, northern Guatemala. Pollen assemblages demonstrate that a mesic forest had been largely established by  11 250 cal. yr BP, but sediment properties indicate that lake level was more than 35 m below modern stage. From 11 250 to 10 350 cal. yr BP, during the Preboreal period, lithologic changes in sediments from deep-water cores (>50m below modern water level) indicate several wet-dry cycles that suggest distinct changes in effective moisture. Four dry events (designated PBE1 -4) occurred centred at 11 200, 10 900, 10 700 and 10 400 cal. yr BP and correlate with similar variability observed in the Cariaco Basin titanium record and glacial meltwater pulses into the Gulf of Mexico. After 10 350 cal. yr BP, multiple sediment proxies suggest a shift to a more persistently moist early Holocene climate. Comparison of results from Lake Peten Itza with other records from the circum-Caribbean demonstrates a coherent climate response during the entire span of our record. Furthermore, lowland Neotropical climate during the late deglacial and early Holocene period appears to be tightly linked to climate change in the high-latitude North Atlantic. We speculate that the observed changes in lowland Neotropical precipitation were related to the intensity of the annual cycle and associated displacements in the mean latitudinal position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and Azores - Bermuda high-pressure system. This mechanism operated on millennial-to-submillennial timescales and may have responded to changes in solar radiation, glacial meltwater, North Atlantic sea ice, and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC).

Continuous, high-resolution temperature records through the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) from tropical oceans have provided much insight but surface temperature reconstructions do not exist from tropical continental environments. Here we used the TEX86 paleotemperature proxy to reconstruct mean annual lake surface temperatures through the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in Lake Malawi, East Africa (9-14S). We find a 3.5C overall warming since the LGM, with temperature reversals of 2C during the Younger Dryas (12.5 ka BP) and at 8.2 ka BP. Maximum Holocene temperatures of 29C were found at 5 ka BP, a period preceding severe drought in Africa. These results suggest a substantial thermal response of southeastern tropical Africa to deglaciation and to varying conditions during the Holocene.

To date, organic geochemical proxies have been developed mainly for use in marine systems and are widely used in paleoceanography. In contrast, organic proxies have been less commonly used on lacustrine sedimentary records. One reason for this is that the wide range in the physical and chemical properties of lakes complicates application of some organic geochemical proxies in lacustrine settings. Furthermore, in comparison to marine studies, presently only a small number of studies have conducted or are currently conducting fundamental research aimed at developing organic geochemical proxies for use in lacustrine settings. Despite this, an increasing number of (paleo)limnological studies are currently applying organic geochemical techniques to examine present and past environmental conditions. In this manuscript we review the use of a number of commonly utilized organic geochemical and isotopic proxies and discuss their potential for environmental reconstruction in Quaternary lacustrine deposits.  2011 Elsevier Ltd." ;

ns3:4fe6a48d\-7b64\-3453\-97f5\-aaa5beca74ac	ns2:abstracttext	"We analyze the geochemistry of Rano Aroi mire record (Easter Island) using bulk peat composition (C, N, S) and stable isotopes (13C, 15N, 34S) and major, minor and trace elemental compositions obtained by ICP-AES (Al, Ti, Zr, Sc, V, Y, Fe, Mn, Th, Ba, Ca, Mg and Sr). Peat geochemistry and the pollen record are used to reconstruct the environmental changes during the last 70kyr BP. Principal component analysis on ICP-AES data revealed that three main components account for the chemical signatures of the peat. The first component, characterized by lithogenic elements (combined signal of V, Al, Sc, Y, Cr, Cd, Ti, Zr and Cu), evidences long-term changes in the basal fluxes of mineral material into the mire. This component, in combination with stable isotopes and pollen data suggests a link between soil erosion and vegetation cover changes in the Rano Aroi watershed. The second component is identified by the signal of Fe, Mn, Th, Ba, Zr and Ti, and is indicative of strong runoff events during enhanced precipitation periods. The third component (tied mainly to Ca, Sr and Mg) reflects a strong peat oxidation event that occurred during an arid period with more frequent droughts, sometime between 39 and 31kyr BP. Correlation coefficients and a multiple regression model (PCR analysis) between peat organic chemistry and the principal components of ICP-AES analysis were calculated. Isotope chemistry of the peat organic matter further contributes to define Rano Aroi environmental history: 13C data corroborates a vegetation shift documented by the palynological record from C4 to C3 between 55 and 45calkyr BP; the 15N record identifies periods of changes in mire productivity and denitrification processes, while the 34S peat signature indicates a marine origin of S and significant diagenetic cycling. The geochemical and environmental evolution of Rano Aroi mire is coherent with the regional climatic variability and suggests that climate was the main forcing in mire evolution during the last 70kyr BP. The coupling of geochemical and biological proxies improves our ability to decipher depositional processes in tropical and subtropical peatlands and to use these sequences for paleoenvironmental and paleoclimate reconstructions." ;

Using 230Th dates and counting of annual-layers, the shift into the YD began at 12,850  40 yr BP and took 340 yrs and the shift out of the YD began at 11,560  40 yr BP and took <38 yrs (best estimate 20 yrs), broadly similar to previously reported AM records from central and southeastern China. The more gradual nature of the start of the YD event as observed in the AM records appears to contrast with the more abrupt beginning observed in the Greenland ice records. The total amplitude of the AM YD event is also smaller than the amplitude of the AM Heinrich Stadial 1 event. In addition, the general rising trend of the AM during the Blling-Allerd period contrasts with the general cooling trend in Greenland temperature during that time. The influence of rising insolation on the AM may explain this observation." ;

The cores serve as a good case study for the construction of an age model for sequences that extend beyond the range of radiocarbon dating. From a variety of potential age indicators, we selected a combination of radiocarbon ages, one magnetic excursion (correlated to a standard sequence), and a single Uranium-series age to develop an initial data set. The reliability of the excursion and U-series data require consideration of their position with respect to sediments of inferred interglacial character, but not direct correlation with other paleoclimate records. Data omitted from the age model include amino acid age estimates, which have a large amount of scatter, and tephrochronology correlations, which have relatively large uncertainties. Because the initial data set was restricted to the upper half of the BL00-1 core, we inferred additional ages by direct correlation to the independently dated paleoclimate record from Devils Hole. We developed an age model for the entire core using statistical methods that consider both the uncertainties of the original data and that of the curve-fitting process, with a combination of our initial data set and the climate correlations as control points. This age model represents our best estimate of the chronology of deposition in Bear Lake. Because the age model contains assumptions about the correlation of Bear Lake to other climate records, the model cannot be used to address some paleoclimate questions, such as phase relationships with other areas.  2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Reliable chronological data are essential to interpret the lake-bottom sediments and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating is an important method to build up the chronology. We report on material-property studies and OSL-dating results for polymineral fine grains extracted from piston cores obtained from the northern basin of Lake Malawi during the 1998 campaign of the International Decade of the East African Lakes (IDEAL). OSL-dating is based on a post-IR blue (pIRB) light stimulation single aliquot regeneration (SAR) protocol. Our results support earlier publications demonstrating the general applicability of OSL-dating on Lake Malawi sediments of Holocene and late Pleistocene age. However, the study also shows that dose rate estimations imply major challenges which need to be investigated in more detail to improve future OSL-dating results.  2012 Elsevier B.V." ;

New dates and re-examination of evidence from widely distributed cores shows that desiccation occurred some time between 15 900 and 14 200 calendar years BP, and perhaps also ca. 18-17 kyr BP. These lake level minima were briefer than has been previously suggested and were synchronous with pronounced global climate disruptions including North Atlantic ice-rafting Heinrich event 1. Less severe declines occurred during the Older and Younger Dryas intervals. Dansgaard-Oeschger type cooling cycles registered in the GISP2 ice core record tracked major lake level regressions in East Africa and weakenings of Afro-Asian monsoons during the late Quaternary, possibly linking the desiccation of Lake Victoria to century-scale reductions in solar radiation output.  2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Using the dung fungus Sporormiella and other paleoecological proxies from Appleman Lake, Indiana, and several New York sites, we established that the megafaunal decline closely preceded enhanced fire regimes and the development of plant communities that have no modern analogs. The loss of keystone megaherbivores may thus have altered ecosystem structure and function by the release of palatable hardwoods from herbivory pressure and by fuel accumulation. Megafaunal populations collapsed from 14,800 to 13,700 years ago, well before the final extinctions and during the Blling-Allerd warm period. Human impacts remain plausible, but the decline predates Younger Dryas cooling and the extraterrestrial impact event proposed to have occurred 12,900 years ago." ;

ns3:50f9e867\-e633\-33d3\-9951\-1d8cb8a0bb68	ns2:abstracttext	"The succession of sedimentary subfacies in the Medicine Lake basin (South Dakota, USA) documents numerous changes in total dissolved solids (TDS), lake level, and the nature and stability of meromixis during the Holocene. The lake formed about 10.6 ka B.P. when coarse clastics and massive fine-grained muds were deposited in a well-mixed freshwater system. Subsequently the lake became saline and meromictic, depositing a finely laminated unit composed of variegated and gray muds, organic facies, gypsum and aragonite laminae. Phototrophic bacterial plate communities (BPC) at the chemocline were significant producers of pelagic organic matter. Relatively high lake levels (at least 10 m higher than today) but saline and meromictic conditions predominated through the early to mid Holocene. At the end of this phase, lake level dropped and stable meromixis was disrupted. Sands and massive or banded muds were deposited in sublittoral areas and benthic microbial communities (BMC) spread over the lake, replacing BPCs as the predominant microbial producers. When lake level rose again, massive and laminated units were deposited under less saline conditions. Another pronounced episode of low lake level and high salinity followed. The most recent sediments are sapropels, massive or banded muds, and littoral sands. The 18O record from authigenic aragonite shows more positive values during the arid mid-Holocene interval, with an abrupt increase at the end of this period, followed by generally more negative values during the cooler and wetter late Holocene. The small range of 18O values (3%.) suggests that the lake was well buffered against high-frequency climatic cycles, probably as a result of groundwater modulation. We postulate that meromixis and the type of photosynthetic microbial communities dominating the basinal region of the lake system-either BPCs or BMCs-exerted major controls on the carbon cycle, and consequently, on the development of isotopic trends linking 13C and 18O values. More negative 13C values during the early and mid Holocene are interpreted as a consequence of the predominance of 12C-enriched microbial carbon from BPCs. Examples of both covariant and inverse covariant isotope trends between 13C and 18O values occur in the Medicine Lake record. Inverse covariant trends characterize long periods of stable meromixis when BPCs predominate over BMCs. We hypothesize that well-developed water stratification caused by greater influx of relatively 18O-depleted freshwater induces higher productivity at the chemocline and, consequently, more positive 13C values in the precipitated carbonates. Unstable phases of meromixis or holomictic conditions are characterized by a predominance of BMCs or other biogenic producers over BPCs, and a number of other factors combine to promote covariant trends. The Medicine Lake record is consistent with the paleoclimatic interpretation for the northern Great Plains of a more arid early and middle Holocene followed by an abrupt transition to a relatively cooler and wetter late Holocene. The sedimentary succesion in Medicine Lake documents a much more fluctuating and abrupt climate behavior than suggested by the vegetation paleorecord and suggest a late Holocene climate punctuated by arid episodes.  1995." ;

The selected lake sequences provide an integrated approach from northern Iberia exploring temperature conditions, humidity variations and land-sea comparisons during the most relevant climate transitions of the last glacial period. Thus, we present evidence that demonstrates: (i) cold but relatively humid conditions during the transition from MIS 5 to MIS 4, which prevailed until ca. 60,000 cal yrs BP in northern Iberia; (ii) a general tendency towards greater aridity during MIS 4 and MIS 3 (ca 60,000 to 23,500 cal yrs BP) punctuated by abrupt climate changes related to Heinrich Events (HE), (iii) a complex, highly variable climate during MIS 2 (23,500 to 14,600 cal yrs BP) with the Mystery Interval (MI: 18,500 to 14,600 cal yrs BP) and not the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM: 23,000 to 19,000 cal yrs BP) as the coldest and most arid period. The last glacial transition starts in synchrony with Greenland ice records at 14,600 cal yrs BP but the temperature increase was not so abrupt in the Iberian records and the highest humidity was attained during the Allerd (GI-1a to GI-1c) and not during the Blling (GI-1e) period. The Younger Dryas event (GS-1) is discernible in northern Iberian lake records as a cold and dry interval, although Iberian vegetation records present a geographically variable signal for this interval, perhaps related to vegetation resilience." ;

In the Lake Besbog record the non-arboreal pollen assemblage of the Late Glacial changed abruptly to that of Betula, Quercus and other deciduous types. The date for this change is about 11.6 ka cal b.p. The Quercus assemblage may be composed of pollen blown from intermediate elevations, to which deciduous forest had expanded because of higher summer temperatures related to high summer insolation. At Shiroka Polyana (1400 m) in the modern conifer belt, a similar change did not occur until about 8.8 ka cal b.p. The persistence of the dry steppe or steppe forest in the early Holocene at this lower site can also be attributed to high summer insolation. Thus as atmospheric temperature increased at the end of the Late Glacial, deciduous forests expanded first at intermediate elevations in the Pirin Mountains and only later in the Rhodope Mountains at lower elevations as summer insolation decreased.

Thus, realistic palaeoclimate reconstructions rely in the development of a tight array of well-constrained records with a dense latitudinal coverage. Climatic records from southernmost South America are critical cornerstones to link these Antarctic palaeoclimatic archives with their South American counterparts. At 54 S on the Island of Tierra del Fuego, Lago Fagnano is located in one of the most substantially and extensively glaciated regions of southernmost South America during the Late Pleistocene. This elongated lake is the largest (110 km long) and non-ice covered lake at high southern latitudes. A multi-proxy study of selected cores allows the characterisation of a Holocene sedimentary record. Detailed petrophysical, sedimentological and geochemical studies of a complete lacustrine laminated sequence reveal variations in major and trace elements, as well as organic content, suggesting high variability in environmental conditions. Comparison of these results with other regional records allows the identification of major known late Holocene climatic intervals and the proposal for a time for the onset of the Southern Westerlies in Tierra del Fuego. These results improve our understanding of the forcing mechanisms behind climate change in southernmost Patagonia. Copyright  2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd." ;

This study first conducted a ground magnetic survey combined with lithologic logs to map the extension of basalts. Then it assessed the evolution of ground surface elevations and updated hydraulic heads in the aquifer and aquitard in order to verify the accuracy of previous simulations and develop new predictions on land subsidence employing a one-dimensional, nonlinear, groundwater flow-consolidation model. Results show the presence of shallow basalts that extend from Sierra Santa Catarina into the Chalco Plain, causing a differential consolidation that controls both the distribution of large-scale fractures in the aquitard and the shape of a new lake. Cumulative land subsidence in the center of the Chalco Plain reached 13 m in 2006, thus closely matching previous numerical estimations. Since 1985, the ground surface decline has continued at a rate of 0.40 m/yr, while the potentiometric surface decline in the aquifer proceeds at an average rate of 1.5 m/yr, indicating that the flow system has not yet reached steady-state conditions. Numerical predictions show that under current pumping rates, where the aquitard is 300 m, total land subsidence will reach 19 m by the year 2020; while where the aquitard is 140 m thick, total land subsidence will reach 12 m, and increase the risk of flooding and aquitard fracturing for nearby urban centers." ;

Shifts in the frequency of high-magnitude floods are mediated by moisture availability over midcontinental North America and correspond to the emergence and decline of Cahokiaa major late prehistoric settlement in the Mississippi River floodplain. The absence of large floods from A.D. 600 to A.D. 1200 facilitated agricultural intensification, population growth, and settlement expansion across the floodplain that are associated with the emergence of Cahokia as a regional center around A.D. 1050. The return of large floods after A.D. 1200, driven by waning midcontinental aridity, marks the onset of sociopolitical reorganization and depopulation that culminate in the abandonment of Cahokia and the surrounding region by A.D. 1350. Shifts in the frequency and magnitude of flooding may be an underappreciated but critical factor in the formation and dissolution of social complexity in early agricultural societies." ;

However, our understanding of the magnetic mineral assemblages within speleothems is not well developed. We present tandem rock magnetic characterization of bulk samples and electron microscopy of magnetic extracts from five North American stalagmites. Magnetite and goethite are present in all samples, albeit in varying abundances and morphologies. Magnetite grains are likely detrital, showing evidence of transport and weathering, including plumose markings and etch pits. These grains are unlikely to have precipitated abiotically in the cave environment. Titanomagnetite and exsolved intergrowths of Fe-Ti oxides indicate that a significant portion of the magnetic mineral assemblage is allochthonous and was transported into the caves. These Ti-rich grains display a range of morphologies from euhedral to well rounded, indicating that earlier morphological models for speleothem magnetization do not apply in all geologic settings. Goethite was observed in three morphologies: isolated needles, needle aggregates, and polycrystalline aggregates of randomly oriented nanoscale grains. The magnetite and titanomagnetite, as well as their partially oxidized equivalents, likely hold a depositional remanent magnetization (DRM), whereas if goethite grains were precipitated in situ on the stalagmite drip surface, they are more likely to hold a chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) because of their small size and low saturation magnetization. Until the remanence of goethite can be shown to be paleomagnetically meaningful, we propose that paleomagnetic studies of speleothems include a 150C thermal demagnetization step to remove any goethite remanence. Key Points Magnetic minerals suggest that speleothem remanence falls on a CRM-DRM continuum Observed goethite suggests CRM; magnetite and titanomagnetite indicate DRM Paleomagnetic studies on speleothems should analyze only DRM components 2013.

In the absence of reliable, long-term meteorological records, comparison of the Ti data with information from the rich Spanish colonial period archives and the post-Independence period, confirms that Ti is a proxy for runoff. This interpretation is supported by comparison with other high-resolution archives from the surrounding region, primarily tree rings and other lake sediment sequences. The Juanacatlan Ti record is therefore a proxy for summer, monsoonal rainfall. The record provides new evidence from the Pacific margin of tropical North America of the occurrence of dry conditions through much of the Classic period (c. AD 300-900), and wetter conditions during the later Medieval period (c. AD 1200-1350). The period commonly known as the 'Little Ice Age' (LIA) shows considerable variability, with dry conditions in the early part (c. AD 1400-1600) and wetter conditions, punctuated by multiyear droughts through the eighteenth century. A notable feature of the record is the apparent decoupling of lacustrine sedimentation from the climate since the mid-twentieth century, possibly resulting from anthropogenic disturbance. Preliminary interpretations of the Ti record indicate that patterns are consistent with changes in monsoon strength associated with ENSO and solar forcing over the last two millennia." ;

The level of Lake Agassiz abruptly fell ~ 12.9 cal (11 14C) ka BP, exposing the lake floor over a large region for > 1000 yr. The routing of overflow during this (Moorhead low-water) period is uncertain, and there is evidence on the continent and in ocean basins for both an easterly route through the Great LakesSt. Lawrence to the North Atlantic and for a northwesterly route through the ClearwaterAthabascaMackenzie system to the Arctic Ocean. The Moorhead low water phase coincides with the Younger Dryas cooling, and a causeeffect relationship has been proposed by attributing a change in ocean thermohaline circulation to the re-routing of Lake Agassiz freshwaters from the Gulf of Mexico to more northern oceans. Paleoclimatic interpretations from ecosystems in lake sediments in the region, and a simple calculation of the paleohydrological budget of Lake Agassiz, indicate that the climate remained wet and cool throughout the YD in this region, and was not warm nor dry enough to allow evaporative loss to offset the influx of meltwater and precipitation; thus, the Moorhead phase resulted from changes in the outlet that carried overflow." ;

Ostracode trace-element and bulk-carbonate geochemistry in a core are used to generate a 12,000-year record of salinity fluctuations. The relative amounts of Sr, Ca and Ba in the bulk-carbonate fraction can be linked mechanistically to changes in sediment mineralogy (calcite/aragonite) and/or solute chemistry, whereas the elemental geochemistry of ostracode valves reflect solute chemistry. Associated minima in Sr/Ca, and maxima in Mg/Ca, in ostracode valves from the Devils Lake core may be due to aragonite mediation of Sr chemistry during the precipitation of multiple mineral phases during more saline intervals. The Devils Lake record can be divided into four hydrological periods on the basis of the geochemical proxies: (a) 12.5-9 k.y.: Low salinity; (b) 9.5 4.5 k.y.: Fluctuating, saline conditions with a maximum at about 8 k.y.; (c) 4.5-3.5 k.y.: Low salinity phase, but probably not as fresh as at 12.5-9 k.y.; (d) 3.5 k.y.-Present: Saline phase, although generally less so than 9.5-4.5 k.y.

The periods of highest diatom burial at both sites occurred around 65-69 and 51-60 thousand years ago (ka) after the termination of prolonged, intense drought in the region. These peaks are believed to reflect elevated delivery of dissolved silica to the lake due to acceleration of chemical weathering in the drainage basin. The droughts that preceded these BSi depositional episodes occurred at precessional frequency, corresponding to times of minimum austral spring (or summer?) insolation in the region prior to 60 ka. Subsequent arid spells have not been as severe due to the reduced amplitude of precessional forcing as a result of the superimposed effect of eccentricity. However, biogenic silica records do not show significant sensitivity to precessional forcing. The BSi burial flux in the north basin displays strong millennial-scale variability since 50 ka, with peak values occurring during cold times in the Northern Hemisphere, as reflected in the Greenland ice core records. We observe no relationship between BSi and deposition of volcanic tephras in this system. The central basin core also displays millennial-scale variability in BSi abundance during the past 50 ky, of comparable magnitude to that in the north basin, but without systematic correlation to the north basin BSi or Greenland ice core records. In general, we conclude that BSi profiles from the north and (probably) south basins are more readily interpreted in terms of regional climate dynamics than are BSi profiles from more central locations in long, narrow tropical rift lakes. Diatom burial rates are suspected to be too influenced by silica limitations imposed by diatom production and burial in the upwelling systems at either end of these low-latitude lacustrine systems." ;

It is near the northern limit of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which brings the rainy season to the tropics, so effects of decreasing precipitation due to southern migration of the ITCZ through the Holocene should be observable. Because fault zones and an active volcano lie within the lake, the long-term impact of tectonic and volcanic activity can also be examined. Finally, the fertile volcanic soils near the lake may have encouraged early agriculture. We analyzed diatoms, biogenic silica (BSi), total organic carbon (TOC), water content, volcanic glass, and magnetic susceptibility in a sediment core from Lake Nicaragua with eleven accelerator mass spectroscopy radiocarbon dates, spanning ~5,700 years. Sediment accumulation rates decreased from the bottom to the top of the core, indicating a general drying trend through the Holocene. An increase in eutrophic diatom abundance suggests that pre-Columbian agriculture impacted the lake as early as ~5,400 cal yr BP. Above a horizon of coarser grains deposited sometime between ~5,200 and 1,600 cal yr BP, planktonic diatoms increased and remained dominant to the top of the core, indicating that water depth permanently increased. Although magnetic susceptibility peaked and water content dipped at the coarse horizon, volcanic glass fragments did not increase, suggesting that the coarse horizon and subsequent increase in water depth were caused by tectonic rather than by volcanic activity. Decreased accumulation rates of BSi and TOC indicate that water became clearer when depth increased.  2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht." ;

We apply a numerical ice-sheet model to determine the climatic conditions under which the empirical reconstruction is glaciologically plausible. Modelling constraints are derived from core records of diatom concentration, benthic diatom fraction, and ice-rafted debris occurrence, as well as lake bottom morphology and the present-day ice-cap geometry. Holocene simulations driven by the NGRIP 18 O record that are consistent with the empirical constraints show the most extensive advance of Langjokull ice cap to be its most recent, beginning somewhere between 5 and 3 ka BP. Ice advance in response to the 8.2 ka BP cold event is followed by several thousand years of nearly ice-free conditions in the mid-Holocene. All simulations suggest that the maximum Holocene stand of the ice cap occurred during the Little Ice Age (LIA); those consistent with the constraints show little to no ice advance into Hvitarvatn before  1 ka BP and indicate the lake area occupied by ice was much greater during the LIA than at any previous time. The most plausible simulation results were obtained for a maximum Holocene warming of 3-4 {ring operator} C relative to the 1961-1990 reference, twice the Arctic average, and for Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) precipitation amounts comparable to or slightly greater than the modern. Reconciling the simulated subglacial discharge record to the empirically derived sediment volumes and emplacement times requires mean Holocene sediment concentrations of 0.8-1.6 kg m- 3. These estimates increase to 1.4-2.0 kg m- 3 when sedimentation rates are highest.  2008." ;

Since 6000 cal yr B. P., sediment carbonate abundance has followed a decreasing trend while organic-carbon abundance has increased. The correlation between organic-carbon abundance and the sum of March-April-October-November insolation has an r(2) value of 0.58. We interpret these trends to represent a precession-driven lengthening of the Holocene growing season that has reduced calcite burial by enhancing net annual organic-matter production and associated calcite dissolution. Correlations with regional paleoclimate records suggest that changes in temperature and moisture balance have impacted the distribution of short-term oscillations in carbonate and organic-matter abundance superimposed on the precession-driven trends." ;

To determine the annual retention of road salt, a chloride budget was conducted for a 4150 km2 watershed encompassing the populated areas of the TCMA. In addition to inflows and outflows in the major rivers of the TCMA, multiple sources of chloride were examined, but only road salt and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents were large enough to be included in the analysis. According to the chloride budget, 235,000 t of chloride entered the TCMA annually with the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers, and 355,000 t exited through the Mississippi River. Of the 120,000 t of chloride added annually to the rivers inside the TCMA watershed boundaries, 87,000 t came from WWTPs and 33,000 t came from road salt. Of the 142,000 t of chloride applied annually in the TCMA watershed as road salt (241,000 t NaCl), only 23% (33,000 t) were exported through the Mississippi River and 109,000 t or 77% were retained in the TCMA watershed. Chloride budgets for 10 subwatersheds within the TCMA analyzed in a similar way, gave an average chloride retention rate of 72%. The retention is occurring in the soils, surface waters (numerous lakes, wetlands, and ponds) and in the groundwater. Chloride concentrations in many of these urban water bodies are now considerably higher than the presettlement background levels of less than 3 mg/L with concentrations as high as 2000 mg/L in shallow groundwater wells. The continued accumulation of chloride in the groundwater and surface waters is a cause for concern. Copyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union." ;

The sediment sequence is chronologically constrained with three tephra and nine radiocarbon dates. Temporal variations in titanium, total inorganic carbon, total organic carbon/titanium ratio, carbon/nitrogen ratio, and silica/titanium ratio indicate changes in runoff, salinity, productivity, and sources. Higher concentrations of Ti indicate more runoff during latest Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 (30.328.6 cal ka BP). Runoff was lower during the last glacial maximum (LGM; 2319 cal ka BP) than during the Heinrich 2 event (2624 cal ka BP). The interval of reduced runoff continued up to 17.5 cal ka BP but increased during the Blling/Allerd. Trends of decreasing runoff and increasing salinity are observed throughout MIS 1. Lake Chalco received less runoff during the LGM compared to deglaciation, opposite the trend of other North American tropical records. Different amounts of rainfall at different sites are possibly due to shifts in the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, changes in the size of the Altlantic warm pool, and varying sea-surface temperatures of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans." ;

Thirty accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dates, biostratigraphy and tephra correlation reveal that a 119 m sediment core recovered from the Huinaimarca sub-basin of Lake Titicaca (16.0 to 17.5 S, 68.5 to 70 W; 3810 masl) contains sediments covering > 151,000 years. Correlation of aridity indicators with precessional variations in insolation is used to fine tune the structure of the age-depth curve within this period. Variations in Isoetes concentration (above/below 10,000 grains/cm3) identify the extent of shallow water environments. Examination of another palaeolimnological indicator (Pediastrum) and consideration of the bathymetry of the Huinaimarca sub-basin allow the reconstruction of lake-level fluctuations. These data indicate five wet/dry cycles between c. 151,000 and 14,200 cal yr BP. High stands are suggested during the transition into (c. 134,000 cal yr BP), and out of (c. 114,000 and 92,000 cal yr BP), the last interglacial, and during full glacial conditions (c. 70,000 and 45,000 cal yr BP). These cycles are superimposed on a general trend of deepening lake levels through the glacial period. This interpretation is supported by correlation with sediments from Salar de Uyuni (20S, 68W; 3653 masl). The youngest wet episode is concurrent with palaeolake Minchin (c. 45,000 cal yr BP), with further evidence for an additional wet period commencing c. 28,000 cal yr BP, concomitant with palaeolake Tauca. The timing of lake level fluctuations is also supported by palaeoshoreline reconstructions from the Uyuni-Poopo region. However, our data do not suggest a major peak in lake level in Huinaimarca during the Ouki lake cycle (c. 120,000-98,000 cal yr BP) as inferred from U-Th ages obtained from palaeoshorelines around Lago Poopo. The most extreme dry event occurs during the last interglacial period and resulted in a sedimentary hiatus tentatively dated to c. 121,000-129,000 cal yr BP. The observed wet/dry cycles are shown to have a marked and rapid impact on the vegetation. The aridity of the last interglacial promoted a community dominated by Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthacae, with no modern Andean analogue. Polylepis/Acaena pollen is also shown to fluctuate markedly (0-20%), particularly during the transitions into, and out of, the last interglacial. It is probable that this pollen taxon is primarily representative of the high altitude arboreal genus Polylepis, which is a key component of highly biodiverse Andean woodlands today. Rapid fluctuations indicate the sensitivity of this ecosystem to natural environmental pressure and potential vulnerability to future human impact and climate change. The 100,000 year (eccentricity) solar cycle is shown to be the major controlling factor in moisture balance and vegetation over the last glacial-interglacial cycle. However, significant fluctuations in moisture balance are also evident on timescales considerably shorter than the full glacial-interglacial cycle. We have linked these to precessional (21,000 year) forcing. Nevertheless, precise independent dating during the full glacial cycle is required to confirm the importance of this forcing mechanism.  2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved." ;

A sediment core from Lake Elgygytgyn (NE Russia) provides a continuous high-resolution record from the Arctic spanning the past 2.8 Ma. The core reveals numerous super interglacials during the Quaternary, with maximum summer temperatures and annual precipitation during marine benthic isotope stages (MIS) 11c and 31 ~4-5C and ~300 mm higher than those of MIS 1 and 5e. Climate simulations show these extreme warm conditions are difficult to explain with greenhouse gas and astronomical forcing alone, implying the importance of amplifying feedbacks and far field influences.

New pollen and macrofossil analyses of high stratigraphic resolution combined with well-controlled time-depth curves for Lake Besbog and Lake Kremensko-5 now permit the firm identification of the Lateglacial interstadial interval (Blling-Allerd), dated at 13.8-12.6 ka cal. BP at Besbog and 14.1-12.8 kacal. BP at Kremensko-5 and correlated with the Greenland Interstadial GI-1 (14.5-12.6 ka cal. BP). Macrofossil analyses indicate that during the Blling-Allerd period Betula and Juniperus occurred around the lakes (at 2124-2250 m a.s.l). Following the Younger Dryas a Betula woodland covered the mountains between 1900 and 2250 m in the early Holocene. Because of higher summer insolation at this time, the temperate deciduous forest reached up to 1900 m, or 800 m above their present limit, producing a regional pollen rain that dominated pollen deposition in the cirque lakes. After about 7000 cal. yr BP conifer forests replaced the birch woodland at middle and high elevations.  2006 SAGE Publications." ;

The objective of this study was to determine how the vegetation mosaic and fire regimes on an oak (Quercus spp.)- and pine (Pinus spp.)-dominated sand plain in northwestern Wisconsin responded to climatic changes of the past 1,200 years. We used pollen and charcoal records from a network of sites to investigate the range of natural variability of vegetation on a 1,500-km 2 landscape on the southern part of the sand plain. A major vegetation shift from jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and red pine (P. resinosa) to increased abundance of white pine (P. strobus) occurred between 700 and 600 calendar years before present (cal yr BP), apparently corresponding to more mesic conditions regionally. A decrease in charcoal accumulation rate also occurred at most sites but was not synchronous with the vegetation change. At some sites there were further changes in vegetation and fire regimes occurring 500-300 cal yr BP, but these changes were not as strong or unidirectional as those that occurred 700-600 cal yr BP. Our results suggest that both the composition and the distribution of vegetation of the southern part of the sand plain have been sensitive to relatively small climatic changes, and that the vegetation at the time of European settlement was a transitory phenomenon, rather than a long-term stable condition.  2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

Basal sediment ages from Upper Whitshed Lake indicate ice-free conditions by at least 14,140-15,040 cal yr BP. While Upper and Lower Whitshed Lakes provide only upper limits to relative sea-level change, interbedded layers of freshwater peat and intertidal silt extending more than 11 m below present sea level in Copper River Delta indicate net submergence over the last 6000 years and multiple earthquake deformation cycles. In contrast, Lower Whitshed Lake, situated just above present high tide level, records only one episode of marine sedimentation, commencing AD 1120-1500, that we interpret as the result of isostatic subsidence due to Little Ice Age mass accumulation of the Chugach Mountain glaciers. Lower Whitshed Lake also records isostatic uplift at the end of the Little Ice Age before the end of marine sedimentation caused by ~1.5 m coseismic uplift in the great Alaska earthquake of AD 1964. We successfully explain the records of relative sea-level change from both Copper River Delta and the Whitshed Lakes by integrating the effects of eustatic sea-level rise, glacial isostasy, earthquake deformation cycles, sediment loading, sediment compaction and Late Holocene changes in glacier mass into a single model. This approach provides initial quantitative constraints on the individual contributions of these processes. Taking reasonable estimates of eustasy, post-Last Glacial Maximum and Neoglacial glacial isostatic adjustment and a simple earthquake deformation cycle, we demonstrate that sediment loading and sediment compaction are both contributors to relative sea-level rise at Copper River Delta, together producing subsidence averaging approximately 1.2 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> over the mid to Late Holocene. Further isolation basin studies have the potential to greatly improve our understanding of the individual contributions of these processes in this highly dynamic region." ;

A combination of 18O, 13C, Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca in ostracode calcite aided by Sr/Ca in bulk carbonates are used to constrain the paleoclimatic reconstructions. A fresh-water phase in the early Holocene, indicated by the absence of Candona rawsoni and low concentrations of Sr/Ca in bulk carbonate, was followed by a sharp increase in salinity between 10 800 and 8900 yr B.P. The climate was predominately dry during the late part of the early Holocene and most of the middle Holocene (8900-5000 yr B.P.), when the lake was very sensitive and recorded a series of dry and wet oscillations. Maximum salinity occurred around 5500 yr B.P. and was followed by a gradual decrease between 5000 and 2400 yr B.P. From 2400 yr B.P. the 18O, Mg/Ca, and Sr/Ca in the ostracodes indicate generally wet conditions interrupted by a series of lesser salinity and temperature oscillations lasting until 600 yr B.P. Ostracode geochemistry indicates that a warm and dry climate returned at about the time of the Little Ice Age (600-150 yr B.P.). Ostracode 13C shows a long-term increasing trend during the Holocene, which suggests that lake productivity and atmospheric CO2 exchange made greater contributions to the hypolimnetic carbon pool as the lake became shallower with time." ;

Length distributions of n-alkane chains in modern plants growing at SL were determined and compared to sedimentary distributions in a core spanning the last 13 ka. As a group, submerged and floating aquatic plants contained high proportions of short chain lengths (< nC25) compared to emergent, riparian and upland terrestrial species, for which chain lengths > nC27 were dominant. Changes in the sedimentary n-alkane distribution over time were driven by variable inputs from plant sources in response to changing lake level, sedimentation and plant community composition. A shift toward shorter chain lengths (nC21, nC23) occurred between 3.1 and 2.9 ka and is best explained by an increase in the abundance of aquatic plants and the availability of shallow-water habitat in response to rising lake level. The late Holocene expansion of SL following a dry mid-Holocene is consistent with previous evidence for increased effective moisture and the onset of wetter conditions in the Sierra Nevada between 4.0 and 3.0 ka." ;

The integration of sedimentary facies, elemental and isotopic geochemistry, and biological proxies (diatoms, chironomids and pollen), together with a robust chronological control, provided by AMS radiocarbon dating and 210Pb and 137Cs radiometric techniques, enabled precise reconstruction of the main phases of environmental change, associated with the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), the Little Ice Age (LIA) and the industrial era. Shallow lake levels and saline conditions with poor development of littoral environments prevailed during medieval times (11501300 AD). Generally higher water levels and more dilute waters occurred during the LIA (13001850 AD), although this period shows a complex internal paleohydrological structure and is contemporaneous with a gradual increase of farming activity. Maximum lake levels and flooding of the current littoral shelf occurred during the nineteenth century, coinciding with the maximum expansion of agriculture in the area and prior to the last cold phase of the LIA. Finally, declining lake levels during the twentieth century, coinciding with a decrease in human pressure, are associated with warmer climate conditions. A strong link with solar irradiance is suggested by the coherence between periods of more positive water balance and phases of reduced solar activity. Changes in winter precipitation and dominance of NAO negative phases would be responsible for wet LIA conditions in western Mediterranean regions. The main environmental stages recorded in Lake Estanya are consistent with Western Mediterranean continental records, and show similarities with both Central and NE Iberian reconstructions, reflecting a strong climatic control of the hydrological and anthropogenic changes during the last 800 years." ;

Bear River, the largest river in the Great Basin, enters Bear Lake Valley ~15 km north of the lake. Two 4-m-long cores provide a lake sediment record extending back ~26 cal k.y. The penetrated section can be divided into a lower unit composed of quartz-rich clastic sediments and an upper unit composed largely of endogenic carbonate. Data from modern fluvial sediments provide the basis for interpreting changes in provenance of detrital material in the lake cores. Sediments from small streams draining elevated topography on the east and west sides of the lake are characterized by abundant dolomite, high magnetic susceptibility (MS) related to eolian magnetite, and low values of hard isothermal remanent magnetization (HIRM, indicative of hematite content). In contrast, sediments from the headwaters of the Bear River in the Uinta Mountains lack carbonate and have high HIRM and low MS. Sediments from lower reaches of the Bear River contain calcite but little dolomite and have low values of MS and HIRM. These contrasts in catchment properties allow interpretation of the following sequence from variations in properties of the lake sediment: (1) ca. 26 cal kaonset of glaciation; (2) ca. 2620 cal ka quasi-cyclical, millennial-scale variations in the concentrations of hematite-rich glacial flour derived from the Uinta Mountains, and dolomite- and magnetite-rich material derived from the local Bear Lake catchment (reflecting variations in glacial extent); (3) ca. 2019 cal kamaximum content of glacial flour; (4) ca. 1917 cal kaconstant content of Bear River sediment but declining content of glacial flour from the Uinta Mountains; (5) ca. 1715.5 cal kadecline in Bear River sediment and increase in content of sediment from the local catchment; and (6) ca. 15.514.5 cal kaincrease in content of endogenic calcite at the expense of detrital material. The onset of glaciation indicated in the Bear Lake record postdates the initial rise of Lake Bonneville and roughly corresponds to the Stansbury shoreline. The lake record indicates that maximum glaciation occurred as Lake Bonneville reached its maximum extent ca. 20 cal ka and that deglaciation was under way while Lake Bonneville remained at its peak. The transition from siliciclastic to carbonate sedimentation probably indicates increasingly evaporative conditions and may coincide with the climatically driven fall of Lake Bonneville from the Provo shoreline. Although lake levels fluctuated during the Younger Dryas, the Bear Lake record for this period is more consistent with drier conditions, rather than cooler, moister conditions interpreted from many studies from western North America." ;

During the late Pleistocene, the Bear River flowed into Bear Lake and the lake waters spilled back into the Bear River drainage. At that time, sediment deposition was dominated by siliciclastic sediment and calcite. Lake-level fluctuation during the Holocene and late Pleistocene produced three types of aragonite deposits in the central lake area that are differentiated primarily by grain size, sorting, and diatom assemblage. Lake- margin deposits during this period consisted of sandy deposits including well-developed shoreface deposits on margins adjacent to relatively steep gradient lake floors and thin, graded shell gravel on margins adjacent to very low gradient lakefloor areas. Throughout the period of aragonite deposition, episodic drops in lake level resulted in erosion of shallow-water deposits, which were redeposited into the deeper lake. These sediment-focusing episodes are recognized by mixing of different mineralogies and crystal habits and mixing of a range of diatom fauna into poorly sorted mud layers. Lake-level drops are also indicated by erosional gaps in the shallow-water records and the occurrence of shoreline deposits in areas now covered by as much as 30 m of water. Calcite precipitation occurred for a short interval of time during the Holocene in response to an influx of Bear River water ca. 8 ka. The Pleistocene sedimentary record of Bear Lake until ca. 18 ka is dominated by siliciclastic glacial flour derived from glaciers in the Uinta Mountains. The Bear Lake deep-water siliciclastic deposits are thoroughly bioturbated, whereas shallow-water deposits transitional to deltas in the northern part of the basin are upward-coarsening sequences of laminated mud, silt, and sand. A major drop in lake level occurred ca. 18 ka, resulting in subaerial exposure of the lake floor in areas now covered by over 40 m of water. The subaerial surfaces are indicated by root casts and gypsum-rich soil features. Bear Lake remained at this low state with a minor transgression until ca. 15 ka. A new influx of Bear River water produced a major lake transgression and deposited a thin calcite deposit. Bear Lake quickly dropped to a shallow-water state, accumulating a mixture of calcite and siliciclastic sediment that contains at least two intervals of root-disrupted horizons indicating lake-level drops to more than 40 m below the modern highstand. About 11,500 yr B.P., the lake level rose again through an influx of Bear River water producing another thin calcite layer. The Bear River ceased to flow into the basin and the lake salinity increased, resulting in the aragonite deposition that persisted until modern human activity. The climatic record of Bear Lake sediment is difficult to ascertain by using standard chemical and biological techniques because of variations in the inflow hydrology and the significant amount of erosion and redeposition of chemical and biological sediment components." ;

The circles vary in their degree of development from prominent well-developed forms with flat bare centers and vegetated raised rims to incipient circles nearly covered with vegetation. Current activity of the forms is indicated by recently displaced ploughing blocks, sediment displacement along frost cracks, and oriented stones lying within the loosely packed rims. The formation of patterned ground in this relatively mild maritime environment is attributed to a saturated soil layer, similar to the active layer of permafrost, that is maintained by impermeable bedrock and high annual precipitation. The saturated sediment and frequent freeze-thaw cycles during winter provide a mechanism for the formation and maintenance of patterned ground. -from Authors" ;

Here, we present a high-resolution, multiproxy record from lowland eastern Mesoamerica, studied to reconstruct climate and vegetation history during the last 2,000 years, in particular to evaluate the response of tropical vegetation to the cooling event of the Little Ice Age (LIA). Our data provide evidence that the densest tropical forest cover and the deepest lake of the last two millennia were coeval with the LIA, with two deep lake phases that follow the Sporer and Maunder minima in solar activity. The high tropical pollen accumulation rates limit LIA's winter cooling to a maximum of 2C. Tropical vegetation expansion during the LIA is best explained by a reduction in the extent of the dry season as a consequence of increased meridional flow leading to higher winter precipitation. These results highlight the importance of seasonal responses to climatic variability, a factor that could be of relevance when evaluating the impact of recent climate change." ;

Channels that experienced base-level fall may still be incising, often through glacial diamictons (tills). These tills can be quite competent, behaving more like weak bedrock than unconsolidated sediment, and erode at a fast pace, thus providing a unique opportunity to test models of channel incision and knickpoint migration in transient systems. Here, we integrate light detection and ranging (LiDAR) topography, strath terrace chronology, and numerical modeling to determine knickpoint migration and incision history of the Le Sueur River in central Minnesota, USA. Results indicate that the Le Sueur River is best modeled as a detachment-limited channel, with downstream coarsening related to lag clasts from tills playing a critical factor in longitudinal profile development.The Le Sueur River meanders as it incises, so we coupled the best-fit incision model to a meander model to determine valley excavation history. The excavation history was used to determine a natural background erosion rate, prior to land-use changes associated with settlement and agricultural expansion in the mid-1800s. We compared background fine sediment (silt and clay) erosion rates with historic decadal-average annual suspended loads. Results show that modern fine sediment contributions from sources associated with valley excavation are three times higher than modeled presettlement loads. Recent changes in hydrology associated with land use and climate change have increased flows in rivers, leading to higher sediment loads, not just from field erosion, but from increased bank and bluff erosion in the deeply incised valleys." ;

Multi-proxy studies provide another means of evaluating interpretations of proxies. This paper presents a multi-proxy assessment comparing 19 sub-centennially resolved late Holocene proxy records, covering the period 300-1900 AD, from seven Icelandic marine and lacustrine core sites. We employ simple statistical comparisons between proxy reconstructions to evaluate their correlations over time and, ultimately, their utility as proxies for regional climate. Proxies examined include oxygen isotopic composition of benthic and planktonic foraminifera, abundance of the sea-ice biomarker IP25, allochthonous quartz in marine sediments (a proxy for drift ice around Iceland), marine carbonate abundance, total organic carbon concentration, chironomid assemblages, lacustrine biogenic silica and carbon/nitrogen ratios in lake sediments. Most of the examined proxy records, including temperature and sea-ice proxies, correlate strongly with each other over multi-centennial timescales, and thus do appear to record changes in regional climate.  2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd." ;

A three-dimensional surface-water-groundwater model was developed to assess the effects of mid-Holocene climate change on water resources within the Crow Wing Watershed, Upper Mississippi Basin in north central Minnesota. The model was first calibrated to a 50 yr historical record of average annual surface-water discharge, monthly groundwater levels, and lake-level fluctuations. The model was able to reproduce reasonably well long-term historical records (1949-1999) of water-table and lake-level fluctuations across the watershed as well as stream discharge near the watershed outlet. The calibrated model was then used to reproduce paleogroundwater and lake levels using climate reconstructions based on pollen-transfer functions from Williams Lake just outside the watershed. Computed declines in mid-Holocene lake levels for two lakes at opposite ends of the watershed were between 6 and 18 m. Simulated streamflow near the outlet of the watershed decreased to 70% of modern average annual discharge after 200 yr. The area covered by wetlands for the entire watershed was reduced by 16%. The mid-Holocene hydrologic changes indicated by these model results and corroborated by several lake-core records across the Crow Wing Watershed may serve as a useful proxy of the hydrologic response to future warm, dry climatic forecasts (ca. 2050) made by some atmospheric general-circulation models for the glaciated Midwestern United States.  2007 Geological Society of America." ;

Most lakes in the upper Midwestern U.S. were formed by glaciers at the end of the last Ice Age approximately 11,700 cal yr BP. Devils Lake, Wisconsin is a rare example of a lake from this region whose sediments extend into the Pleistocene and may include the Last Glacial Maximum. Sediment magnetic, geochemical, pollen, and charcoal records were generated from a 10 m core whose basal sediments may be 28,000 years old. Together with a previously published pollen record, these proxies combine to reveal a history of long-term climatic, vegetative and geologic change during the late Pleistocene to Holocene. We identify six sedimentary units that indicate a series of consecutive events rather than a predictable trajectory of ecosystem development at the site. Productivity in the lake was low during the late Pleistocene and increased during the Holocene, as reflected by the sediment lithology, which shows a sudden shift from glacial vivianite-rich and organic-poor clastic-dominated sediments to Holocene diatomaceous sapropels. Several important processes initiated around 17,000 cal yr BP, including the onset of organic matter accumulation and fire in the terrestrial ecosystem. However, the post-glacial landscape was not devoid of vegetation because pollen assemblages indicate that terrestrial vegetation, likely a spruce tundra, survived near the site. A switch to a hardwood forest period during the Holocene also led to a change in the fire regime, with increased frequency of burning. Aquatic ecosystem productivity lagged terrestrial ecosystem productivity throughout the record. Nutrient cycling (as recorded by sedimentary 15N) was variable but not directional, and appeared to be correlated with climate conditions early in the record, and terrestrial ecosystem processes later in the record. Throughout the Holocene magnetic mineral concentration decreased as productivity increased, and the source of magnetic material shifted from almost exclusively lithogenic to approximately 50% derived from soil or biogenic sources. Magnetic grain size, Ambrosia pollen percentages, and charcoal concentration increased and 15N decreased in the most recent part of the record, due to anthropogenic influence in the region including agricultural activities." ;

We measured loss on ignition (LOI), carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N), diatom abundance, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), TN:TP ratio, and carbon and nitrogen isotopes (13C and 15N) in an 83-cm sediment core to track recent trophic status changes in Beaver Reservoir, Northwest Arkansas, USA. Measurements showed that LOI, TN, TP and diatom abundance increased significantly from the bottom to the top of the core (p < 0.001). The C:N ratio and 13C indicated a predominantly algal source for organic matter in the sediments. Increases in TN and TP were positively correlated with human population growth (p < 0.01) and the TN:TP ratio recorded a shift from phosphorus to nitrogen limitation around 1990. This shift may have encouraged cyanobacterial growth that caused episodes of taste and odor problems in the reservoir. This study suggests that despite concerns about sediment dating and disturbance, reservoir sediments can provide valuable information on past water quality changes.  2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht." ;

The demise of Lake Ojibway occurred when an ice dam of the shrinking Laurentide Ice Sheet failed, perhaps releasing enough freshwater to impede Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and precipitate the 8200 cal BP climatic cooling event. Previously published records and new information from lacustrine sediment cores are combined to reconstruct a varve record over 2100 years long. Between varves numbered 1 to 1500, average rates of ice margin retreat increased from 140 m/y to as high as 400 m/y. Beginning prior to varve year 1800, and lasting to around year 2000, ice readvanced along a front at least 300 km wide during an episode called the Cochrane. The total distance of the advance was at least 75 km, and averaged around 200 m/y. During the advance, a series of ~50 anomalously thick varves were deposited, the cause of which is uncertain. A widespread unconformity occurred during the end of the Cochrane advance, which was followed at around varve year 2060 by the return of varves, which thicken abruptly. Unlike previous varves, these varves include ice-rafted pellets of Lake Ojibway sediment. These varves may have resulted from rapid melting and calving, rather than a second advance, and may relate to basin re-filling following a lowstand. There are no direct dates on the Lake Ojibway varves, but a sudden increase in varve thickness at year 1528 is a regional stratigraphic marker that may have resulted from glacial sediment and meltwater (including Lake Agassiz overflow), diverted from routes to the Lake Superior basin, into the Lake Ojibway basin. Dates from the Lake Superior basin suggest that the diversion of this water occurred at around 9040 cal BP. Applying this date to varve 1528 constrains the age of the Lake Ojibway varves numbered 1 to 2100 to between 10,570 and 8470 (200) cal BP.  2011 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA." ;

The 13Cdiatom data show both centennial-to-millennial scale changes related to fluctuations in lake productivity and CO2 concentration in the lake water, and variations in carbon sources to the lake through time. The 18Odiatom data reflect changes in lake hydrology and climate. The combination of 13Cdiatom and 18Odiatom data reveals interactions between the internal lake processes and its catchment runoff. During wet periods (low 18Odiatom values) 13Cdiatom indicates an enhanced contribution of allochthonous carbon, whereas during dry periods (high 18Odiatom) 13Cdiatom values suggest more autochthonous carbon production and recycling. These decadal-to-centennial oscillations are not recognized after 10,000 cal years BP, possibly as a result of ENSO-like phenomenon weakening. Humid conditions during the LateglacialEarly Holocene transition (12,40010,100 cal years BP) were possibly due to the establishment of La Nina-like conditions in the tropical South Pacific. Whereas, dry conditions in the Early Holocene (10,1009100 cal years BP) may be caused by the northward migration of the ITCZ due to both ENSO-like weakening and an insolation minimum. Finally, a return to humid conditions at the end of the Early Holocene (91008300 cal years BP) is coincident with an increase in summer insolation." ;

The results suggest that offshore sedimentation rates have exhibited considerable spatial variation over the past 8000 years, particularly during the mid-Holocene. We attribute offshore, mid-Holocene sedimentation changes to alterations in whole basin circulation, perhaps precipitated by a greater dominance of the Gulf of Mexico air mass during the summer season. Nearshore bays are characterized by high sedimentation rates for at least 1000 years after varve cessation and during a period between around 4500 and 2000 cal. BP. After 2000 cal. BP, sedimentation rates subsided to earlier rates. The increases between 4500 and 2000 cal. BP are probably due to lake level fall after the Nipissing II highstand. The older glaciolacustrine varve thickness records suggest that the influx of glacially derived sediment ended abruptly everywhere in the lake, except near the Lake Nipigon inlets. Multiple sediment cores reveal 36 anomalously thick varves, previously ascribed to the formation of the Nakina moraine, which were deposited just prior to varve cessation in the open lake. The PSV records support the observation that the cessation of these thick varves is a temporally correlative event, occurring at 9035 +/- 170 cal. BP (calibrated years before 1950, ca 7950-8250 C-14 BP). This date would correlate to the eastern diversion of Lake Agassiz and glacial meltwater into Lake Ojibway. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

A broad range of paleoclimate proxy methods have been applied in the Maya Lowlands and the data derived from these methods are sometimes challenging for archeologists and other non-specialists to interpret. This paper reviews the principal methods used for paleoclimate inference in the region and the rationale for climate proxy interpretation to help researchers working in the Maya Lowlands make sense of paleoclimate datasets. In particular, we focus on analyses of speleothems and lake sediment cores. These two paleoclimate archives have been most widely applied in the Maya Lowlands and have the greatest potential to provide insights into climate change impacts on the ancient Maya. We discuss the development of chronologies for these climate archives, the proxies for past climate change found within them, and how these proxy variables are interpreted. Finally, we present strategies for improving our understanding of proxy paleoclimate data from the Maya Lowlands, including multi-proxy analyses, assessment of spatial variability in past climate change, combined analysis of climate models and proxy data, and the integration of paleoclimatology and archeology." ;

Shorelines provide evidence of precise lake levels, but they are infrequently preserved and are poorly dated. For cored sediment similar to that in the modern lake, grain-size distributions provide estimates of past lake depths. Sedimentary textures provide a highly sensitive, continuous record of lake-level changes, but the modern distribution of fabrics is poorly constrained, and many ancient features have no modern analog. Combining the three types of data yields a more robust lake-level history than can be obtained from any one type alone. When smooth age-depth models are used, lake-level curves from multiple cores contain inconsistent intervals (i.e., one record indicates a rising lake level while another record indicates a falling lake level). These discrepancies were removed and the multiple records were combined into a single lake-level curve by developing age-depth relations that contain changes in deposition rate (i.e., gaps) where indicated by sedimentological evidence. The resultant curve shows that, prior to 18 ka, lake level was stable near the modern level, probably because the lake was overflowing. Between ca. 17.5 and 15.5 ka, lake level was ~40 m below the modern level, then fluctuated rapidly throughout the post-glacial interval. Following a brief rise centered ca. 15 ka (= Raspberry Square phase), lake level lowered again to 1520 m below modern from ca. 14.811.8 ka. This regression culminated in a lowstand to 40 m below modern ca. 12.5 ka, before a rapid rise to levels above modern ca. 11.5 ka. Lake level was typically lower than present throughout the Holocene, with pronounced lowstands 1520 m below the modern level ca. 109, 7.0, 6.54.5, 3.5, 3.02.5, 2.0, and 1.5 ka. High lake levels near or above the modern lake occurred ca. 8.58.0, 7.06.5, 4.53.5, 2.5, and 0.7 ka.

In contrast, coeval ostracode and bivalve records from the Lake Huron and Lake Michigan basins are characterized by extreme 18O variations, ranging from values that reflect a source that is primarily glacial ( - 20 PDB) to much higher values characteristic of a regional meteoric source ( - 5 PDB). Re-evaluated age models for the Huron and Michigan records yield a more consistent 18O stratigraphy. The striking feature of these records is a sharp drop in 18O values between 9400 and 9000 cal yr BP. In the Huron basin, this low 18O excursion was ascribed to the late Stanley lowstand, and in the Lake Michigan basin to Lake Agassiz flooding. Catastrophic flooding from Lake Agassiz is likely, but a second possibility is that the low 18O excursion records the switching of overflow from the Lake Superior basin from an undocumented northern outlet back into the Great Lakes basin. Quantifying freshwater fluxes for this system remains difficult because the benthic ostracodes in the glaciolacustrine varves of Lake Superior and Lake Agassiz may not record the average 18O value of surface water.  2009 University of Washington." ;

Water samples from the catchment area and Lake Karakul, and a 104-cm sediment core from its shallow eastern sub-basin, were investigated and provide a first lake record from the region spanning the last 4200 cal yr BP. Multi-proxy analyses revealed the following: A relatively high meltwater inflow from glaciers, snow fields and frozen ground in the catchment as a result of relatively warm conditions was reconstructed for the period between 4200 and 3500 cal yr BP. The shift to colder climatic conditions around 3500 cal yr BP was probably abrupt; total organic carbon values displayed the most dramatic drop for the entire core within less than 40 years. In contrast, the subsequent re-establishment of warmer conditions occurred gradually over several centuries. A higher meltwater supply to the lake and warmer conditions were recorded since ca. 1900 cal yr BP with two slightly colder intervals between 1200 and 800 cal yr BP and between 400 and 100 cal yr BP. The abrupt shift to significantly colder and drier conditions around 3500 cal yr BP in the eastern Pamirs is seen also in records from the Aral Sea and the Guliya ice core from the western Tibetan Plateau. However, more palaeoclimate studies in this highly continental part of Central Asia are needed to assess the spatial and temporal patterns of the Holocene climate in the region.  2010 Elsevier B.V.

Spectral analysis of the pollen data identified peaks at 21-22 and 100 ka corresponding to periodicities in Earth's precession and eccentricity orbital cycles. Suborbital climatic fluctuations recorded in the pollen data, denoted by 6 and 5 ka cyclicities, are similar to Greenland atmospheric temperatures and North Atlantic ice-rafting Heinrich events. Our results show that millennial-scale climate variability is also evident during MIS 5, 6 and 7, including the occurrence of Heinrich-like events in MIS 6, showing the long-term feature of such climate variability. This study provides clear evidence of a highly interconnected ocean-atmosphere system during the last two glacial/interglacial cycles that extended its influence as far as continental western North America. Our study also contributes to a greater understanding of the impact of long-term climate change on vegetation of western North America. Such high-resolution studies are particularly important in efforts of the scientific community to predict the consequences of future climate change." ;

It is, however, unclear whether the largest of the hyperthermals, the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; ref.), had a similar origin as the subsequent greenhouse climate events, such as the Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 and H2 events. The timing and evolution of these events is well documented in marine records, but is not well constrained on land. Here we report carbon isotope records from palaeosol carbonate nodules from the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming, USA that record the hyperthermals. Our age model is derived from cyclostratigraphy, and shows a similar structure of events in the terrestrial and marine records. Moreover, the magnitude of the terrestrial isotope excursions is consistently scaled with the marine records, suggesting that the severity of local palaeoenvironmetal change during each event was proportional to the size of the global carbon isotope excursion. We interpret this consistency as an indication of similar mechanisms of carbon release during all three hyperthermals. However, unlike during the PETM (refs,), terrestrial environmental change during the subsequent hyperthermals is not linked to substantial turnover of mammalian fauna in the Bighorn Basin.  2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

During that period, finely laminated, organic-rich muds (sapropel) containing brine-shrimp cysts and pellets and interbedded sodium-sulfate salts were deposited on the lake floor. Sapropel deposition was probably caused by stratification of the water column  a freshwater cap possibly was formed by groundwater, which had been stored in upland aquifers during the immediately preceding late-Pleistocene deep-lake cycle (Lake Bonneville), and was actively discharging on the basin floor. A climate characterized by low precipitation and runoff, combined with local areas of groundwater discharge in piedmont settings, could explain the apparent conflict between evidence for a shallow lake (a dry climate) and previously published interpretations for a moist climate in the Great Salt Lake basin of the eastern Great Basin." ;

This subdecadally resolved drought record tracks the 1,500-yr tree-ring-based Palmer Drought Severity Index reconstructions of Cook et al. [Cook ER, Woodhouse CA, Eakin CM, Meko DM, Stahle DW (2004) Science 306:1015-1018] in the Pacific Northwest and extends our knowledge back to 6,000 yr B.P. The results demonstrate that low-frequency drought/pluvial cycles, with occasional long-duration, multidecadal events, are a persistent feature of regional climate. Furthermore, the average duration of multidecadal wet/dry cycles has increased since the middle Holocene, which has acted to increase the amplitude and impact of these events. This is especially apparent during the last 1,000 yr. We suggest these transitions were driven by changes in the tropical and extratropical Pacific and are related to apparent intensification of the El Nino Southern Oscillation over this interval and its related effects on the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The Castor Lake record also corroborates the notion that the 20th century, prior to recent aridity, was a relatively wet period compared to the last 6,000 yr. Our findings suggest that the hydroclimate response in the Pacific Northwest to future warming will be intimately tied to the impact of warming on the El Nino Southern Oscillation." ;

ns3:64ab9808\-ef5f\-3de3\-9121\-c7a8b3f0a846	ns2:abstracttext	"West Hawk Lake (WHL) is located within the glacial Lake Agassiz basin, 140 km east of Winnipeg, Manitoba. The small lake lies in a deep, steep-sided, meteorite impact crater, which has been partly filled by 60 m of sediment that today forms a flat floor in the central part of the basin below 111 m of water. Four cores, 5-11 m in length, were collected using a Kullenberg piston gravity corer. All sediment is clay, contains no unconformities, and has low organic content in all but the upper meter. Sample analyses include bulk and clay mineralogy, major and minor elements, TOC, stable isotopes of C, N, and O, pollen, charcoal, diatoms, and floral and faunal macrofossils. The sequence is divided into four units based mainly on thickness and style of lamination, diatoms, and pollen. AMS radiocarbon dates do not provide a clear indication of age in the postglacial sequence; possible explanations include contamination by older organic inwash and downward movement of younger organic acids. A chronological framework was established using only selected AMS dates on plant macrofossils, combined with correlations to dated events outside the basin and paleotopographic reconstructions of Lake Agassiz. The 822 1-cm-thick varves in the lower 8 m of the cored WHL sequence were deposited just prior to 10,000 cal years BP (8,900 14C years BP), during the glacial Lake Agassiz phase of the lake. The disappearance of dolomite near the top of the varved sequence reflects the reduced influence of Lake Agassiz and the carbonate bedrock and glacial sediment in its catchment. The lowermost varves are barren of organisms, indicating cold and turbid glacial lake waters, but the presence of benthic and planktonic algae in the upper 520 varves indicates warming; this lake phase coincides with a change in clay mineralogy, 18O and 13C in cellulose, and in some other parameters. This change may have resulted from a major drawdown in Lake Agassiz when its overflow switched from northwest to east after formation of the Upper Campbell beach of that lake 9,300-9,400 14C years ago. The end of thick varve deposition at 10,000 cal years BP is related to the opening of a lower eastern outlet of Lake Agassiz and an accompanying drop in West Hawk Lake level. WHL became independent from Lake Agassiz at this time, sedimentation rates dropped, and only 2.5 m of sediment was deposited in the next 10,000 years. During the first two centuries of post-Lake Agassiz history, there were anomalies in the diatom assemblage, stable O and C isotopes, magnetic susceptibility, and other parameters, reflecting an unstable watershed. Modern oligotrophic conditions were soon established; charcoal abundance increased in response to the reduced distance to the shoreline and to warmer conditions. Regional warming after 9,500 cal years BP is indicated by pollen and diatoms as well as C and O isotope values. Relatively dry conditions are suggested by a rise in pine and decrease in spruce and other vegetation types between 9,500 and 5,000 cal years BP (8,500-4,400 14C years BP), plus a decrease in 13Ccell values. After this, there was a shift to slightly cooler and wetter conditions. A large increase in organic content and change in elemental concentration in the past several thousand years probably reflects a decline in supply of mineral detritus to the basin and possibly an increase in productivity.  2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

We present lake sediment core data from Fallen Leaf Lake, a subalpine system at the southern end of the Lake Tahoe basin for which 80% of the contemporary inflow is derived from snowpack delivered by Pacific frontal storm systems. A high quality age model has been constructed using 14C ages on plant macrofossils, 210Pb, and the Tsoyowata tephra datum (7.747.95 cal kyr BP). One core captures the transition from the Late Tioga-younger Dryas glaciolacustrine package to laminated opaline clay at 11.48 cal kyr BP. Early Holocene sedimentation rates are relatively high (1.9 mm/year) and cooler winter temperatures are inferred by the presence of pebbles interpreted to be transported out into the lake via shore ice. There is a geochemically distinct interval from 4.71 to 3.65 cal kyr BP that is interpreted as a late Holocene neopluvial, characterized by depleted 13C and lower C:N that point to reduced runoff of terrigenous organic matter, increased winter precipitation, and increased algal productivity. The largest Holocene signal in the cores occurs at the end of the neopluvial, at 3.65 cal kyr BP, and marks a shift into a climate state with variable precipitation, yet is overall more arid than the neopluvial. This new climate state persists for 3 ka, until the Little Ice Age. Low sedimentation rates (0.5 mm/year), the homogeneous opaline sediment, and steadily increasing contributions of terrestrial vs. algal organic matter in these cores suggest that the lowstand state of Fallen Leaf Lake may have been the norm from 3.65 to 0.55 cal kyr BP, punctuated by short term high precipitation years or multi-year intervals capable of rapid short duration lake level rise. Fallen Leaf Lake is strongly influenced by changes in winter precipitation and temperature, manifested largely by the geochemical proxies, and highlights unique advantages of subalpine lakes in regional paleoclimate reconstructions." ;

ns3:659962eb\-1f30\-3d0d\-b1cb\-fd0a0c0ef49b	ns2:abstracttext	"We present a high-resolution, multiproxy reconstruction of the depositional history of Lake Arreo, northern Spain, for the last 60 years. We conducted sedimentological, geochemical and diatom analyses in short cores and made a detailed comparison with regional instrumental climate data (19522007), limnological monitoring of the lake (19922008) and recent land use changes that affect the lake catchment. Chronology is based on floating discontinuous varve counts and 137Cs and 14C dates. Four periods were identified in the Lake Arreo recent history: (1) prior to 1963, varved facies intercalated with fine turbidite deposits, and diatom assemblages dominated by Cyclotella taxa indicate predominantly meromictic conditions, (2) from 1964 to 1978, permanent anoxia persisted in bottom waters, as shown by similar facies and diatom assemblages as before, though detrital layers were coarser, (3) from 1979 to 1994, sediment delivery to the lake increased and laminated, clastic facies were deposited, and (4) from 1995 to 2008, dominance of massive facies and an increase in Fragilaria tenera and Achnanthes minutissima reflect relatively lower lake levels, less frequent bottom anoxia with more frequent water column mixing, similar to modern conditions. The period 19521979 was a time of meromixis and varved facies deposition, and was characterized by higher rainfall and less intense agricultural pressure in the watershed. There were two short humid periods (19921993 and 19961998) when monitoring data show more anoxic weeks per year and relatively higher lake levels. Increased cultivation of small landholdings in 1963, and particularly after 1979, caused a large increase in sediment delivery to the lake. The inferred lake evolution is in agreement with monitoring data that suggest a transition from dominantly meromictic conditions prior to 19931994 to a predominantly monomictic pattern of circulation since then, particularly after 2000. The synergistic effects of intensive water extraction for irrigation and lower rainfall since 1979, and particularly since 1994, brought the long period of meromictic conditions in Lake Arreo to an end. Water balance and sediment delivery to the lake are dominant factors that control the limnological and mixing conditions in Lake Arreo and they must be considered in management and restoration plans." ;

Basin-floor and basin-closure morphometry have set limits on palaeolake sizes; lake morphometry and basin drainage patterns have influenced lacustrine processes; and water and sediment loads have influenced basin neotectonics. Information regarding inundated, runoff-producing, and extra-basin spatial domains is acquired directly from the palaeolake record, including the littoral morphostratigraphic record, and indirectly by reconstruction. Increasingly detailed hypotheses regarding Lake Bonneville, the largest late Pleistocene palaeolake in the Great Basin, are subjects for further testing and refinement. Oscillating transgression of Lake Bonneville began about 28 ka, the highest stage occurred about 15 ka, and termination occurred abruptly about 13 ka. A final resurgence of perennial lakes probably occurred in many subbasins of the Great Basin between 11 and 10 ka, when the highest stage of Great Salt Lake (successor to Lake Bonneville) developed the Gilbert shoreline -- and when the Russell shoreline formed 500-600 km away, in the Carson Desert of the Lake Lahontan basin. The highest post-Gilbert stage of Great Salt Lake, which has been one of the few permanent lakes in the Great Basin during Holocene time, probably occurred between 3 and 2 ka. A set of eighteen general observations regarding geologic aspects of the palaeolake record in semidesert basins is helping to guide Quaternary studies in the Great Basin." ;

Phytolith morphological assemblages extracted from sediments and buried soils are increasingly used as proxies of grassland diversity and tree cover density. When found in significant amounts in archeological sites they can be used for identifying food habits, cultural and agricultural practices. Phytoliths can contain small amounts of C occluded in their structure (phytC). It is generally assumed that the source of this phytC is atmospheric CO2 that was fixed by the plant via photosynthesis. Isotopic analyses of phytoliths (13C, 14C) were thus expected to inform respectively on the photosynthetic pathway or on the age of the mineralized host plants. However recent 14C analyses of phytC from phytolith concentrates extracted from soils and harvested grasses yielded unexpected 14C ages of several hundreds to kyr old. These 14C phytC results raised the question of a possible source of refractory/old soil organic matter component taken up by roots, which can be attached or occluded in phytoliths. Simultaneously these results highlighted the need for setting standardized protocols leading to concentrates entirely devoid of organic residues, as well as for a robust method for checking phytolith purity. The goal of this work was thus to develop protocols for extracting phytoliths from plants, leading to 100% phytolith purity, as required for phytC analyses. Protocol 1 utilizes a multi-step process of dry ashing and acid digestion, while protocol 2 also uses acid digestion as well as a separate alkali immersion step which removes surface layers. Phytolith concentrate purity was gauged in a semi-quantitative fashion through the use of SEM-EDS analysis. This quality check for phytolith purity can reveal small C particulate contamination of phytolith concentrates that may considerably bias isotopic and quantitative analyses of phytC. Results indicate that the two protocols were able to entirely remove small C particulate contamination. Protocol 1 produced phytolith concentrates with well defined morphologies suitable for both morphological and isotopic analyses. However measurement of C yields showed that protocol 1 probably induced C leakage, leading to lower recovery. Protocol 2 is faster, leads to higher C yield but may lead to a beginning of dissolution. With these protocols on hand, sources of phytC can be properly investigated.  2013 Elsevier B.V." ;

Terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) ages (48) on moraines and radiocarbon-dated clastic sediment records from a moraine-dammed lake at Nevado Huaguruncho, Peru, document the waxing and waning of alpine glaciers in the Eastern Cordillera during the past 15 k.y. The integrated moraine and lake records indicate that ice advanced at 14.1  0.4 ka, during the first half of the Antarctic Cold Reversal, and began retreating by 13.7  0.4 ka. Ice retreated and paraglacial sedimentation declined until ca. 12 ka, when proxy indicators of glacigenic sediment increased sharply, heralding an ice advance that culminated in multiple moraine positions from 11.6  0.2 ka to 10.3  0.2 ka. Proxy indicators of glacigenic sediment input suggest oscillating ice extents from ca. 10 to 4 ka, and somewhat more extensive ice cover from 4 to 2 ka, followed by ice retreat. The lack of TCN ages from these intervals suggests that glaciers were less extensive than during the late Holocene. A final Holocene advance occurred during the Little Ice Age (LIA, ca. 0.4 to 0.2 ka) under colder and wetter conditions as documented in regional proxy archives. The pattern of glacier variability at Huaguruncho during the Late Glacial and Holocene is similar to the pattern of tropical Atlantic sea-surface temperatures, and provides evidence that prior to the LIA, ice extent in the eastern tropical Andes was decoupled from temperatures in the high-latitude North Atlantic." ;

Isotopic analyses of bulk sediment samples capture millennial-scale variability. Ostracode calcite was analyzed from 78 levels, mainly from the upper half of the core where valves are better preserved, to compare the isotopic value of purely endogenic carbonate with the bulk sediment, which comprises both endogenic and detrital components. The long core exhibits three relatively brief intervals with abundant endogenic aragonite (5010%) and enriched 18O and 13C. These intervals are interpreted as warm/dry periods when the lake retracted into a topographically closed basin. We correlate these intervals with the interglacial periods of marine oxygen-isotope stages 1, 5e, and 7a, consistent with the presently available geochronological control. During most of the time represented by the core, the lake was fresher than the modern lake, as evidenced by depleted 18O and 13C in bulk-sediment carbonate.  2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Natural vertical mixing of lentic surface water bodies can be hindered by the presence of a benthic saline layer and thereby affect lake water quality and ecology. To study the formation and disappearance of the saline layer, temperature and specific conductance profiles were measured intermittently over two years (2007, 2008) and at high frequency during one year (2009) in an urban lake of the northern temperate region (Tanners Lake, Oakdale, Minnesota). Erosion of the saline layer in the spring occurred only in year 2007. In years 2008 and 2009, the saline layer persisted throughout the summer only to be removed during fall turnover when thermal stratification was at a minimum. In all three years, salinity dominated density stratification after ice-out, but was quickly overtaken by temperature stratification as the epilimnion warmed. The deterministic, unsteady dynamic one-dimensional (1D) lake temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) model MINLAKE was modified by including vertical salinity gradients, and it was used to simulate summer stratification and mixing dynamics in Tanners Lake. The daily adjustment of the hypolimnetic eddy diffusion as a function of lake number was an important component in the developed model. This addition allowed mixing in the hypolimnion to be stronger in the fall and spring when the lake stratification was weaker than in the summer after thermal stratification formed. Model results of dissolved oxygen in the water column demonstrated that the saline benthic layer can prevent dissolved oxygen from reaching lake sediments. The adverse consequences of dissolved oxygen depletion on phosphorus recycling from the sediments, benthic microbial communities, and fish habitat are well known. Overall, the results show how salinity from road salt applications can influence water quality and natural mixing in urban lakes.  2012 American Society of Civil Engineers." ;

Warmer and relatively arid conditions prevailed during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, ca. 900-1300 AD), with a significant development of xerophytes and Mediterranean vegetation and limited deciduous tree formations (mesophytes). The Little Ice Age (LIA, 1300-1800 AD) was generally colder and moister, with an expansion of deciduous taxa and cold-adapted montane conifers. Two major phases occurred within this period: (i) a transition MCA-LIA, characterized by fluctuating, moist conditions and relatively cold temperatures (ca. 1300 and 1600 AD); and (ii) a second period, characterized by the coldest and most humid conditions, coinciding with maximum (recent) glacier advances (ca. 1600-1800 AD). Glaciers retreated after the LIA when warmer and more arid conditions dominated, interrupted by a short-living cooling episode during the late 19th to early 20th centuries. Some records suggest a response to solar activity with colder and slightly moister conditions during solar minima. Centennial-scale hydrological fluctuations are in phase with reconstructions of NAO variability, which appears to be one of the main climate mechanisms influencing rainfall variations in the region during the last millennium.  2012 Author(s)." ;

Rock magnetic analysis supplemented by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analysis were performed on sediment core TOW10-9B from the north basin of Lake Towuti to give insights on the environmental and sedimentary processes controlling the magnetic properties of the sediment and its paleoclimatic significance. The results show that the core has three distinct zones of varying magnetic properties. Careful examination demonstrates that these zones correspond to varying levels of iron oxide dissolution and magnetite precipitation that are climatically and environmentally dependent. The magnetically strongest zone is characterized by weak iron oxide dissolution and intense magnetite precipitation, likely driven by changes in the stratification and/or water level of the lake during dry conditions in Marine Isotope Stage 2 (MIS2) period, whereas the two magnetically weaker zones are characterized by signs of dissolution and correspond to relatively wet conditions, respectively, during Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS3) and the Holocene. Although our data show that major changes in concentration dependent parameters, such as magnetic susceptibility and saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM), in Lake Towuti sediment correlate with changes in regional rainfall, many of the concentration changes are more strongly affected by in situ chemical processes than by changes in erosion and terrestrial sediment supply. These findings urge caution in the interpretation of magnetic mineral concentration profiles as indicators of clastic sediment inputs." ;

This unique sediment record shows that (18)O peaked during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) from A.D. 900 to 1100, providing evidence that the SASM weakened considerably during this period. Minimum (18)O values occurred during the Little Ice Age (LIA) between A.D. 1400 and 1820, reflecting a prolonged intensification of the SASM that was regionally synchronous. After the LIA, (18)O increased rapidly, particularly during the current warm period (CWP; A.D. 1900 to present), indicating a return to reduced SASM precipitation that was more abrupt and sustained than the onset of the MCA. Diminished SASM precipitation during the MCA and CWP tracks reconstructed Northern Hemisphere and North Atlantic warming and a northward displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) over the Atlantic, and likely the Pacific. Intensified SASM precipitation during the LIA follows reconstructed Northern Hemisphere and North Atlantic cooling, El Nino-like warming in the Pacific, and a southward displacement of the ITCZ over both oceans. These results suggest that SASM mean state changes are sensitive to ITCZ variability as mediated by Western Hemisphere tropical sea surface temperatures, particularly in the Atlantic. Continued Northern Hemisphere and North Atlantic warming may therefore help perpetuate the recent reductions in SASM precipitation that characterize the last 100 years, which would negatively impact Andean water resources." ;

The first occurred during the PleistoceneHolocene transition (~ 12.59.5 ka) and is interpreted as paraglacial landscape response to deglaciation after the LGM. Evidence of the second period of aggradation is limited but indicates a small pulse of sedimentation at ~ 5.5 ka. A third, more broadly identifiable period of sedimentation occurred in the late Holocene (~ 2.21 ka). The latest two periods of aggradation are concurrent with increases in the frequency of climate change in the region suggesting that Holocene alpine and sub-alpine landscapes respond more to rapid changes in climate than to large singular climatic swings. Soil development and radiocarbon dating indicate that hillslopes were stable during the Holocene even while aggradation was occurring in valley bottoms. Thus, we can conclude that erosion does not occur equally throughout the landscape but is focused upslope of headwater streams, along tributary channels, or on ridge tops. This is in contrast to some models which assume equal erosion in headwater basins." ;

We have obtained the first radiocarbon-dated evidence for a mid-Wisconsin thermokarst lake, demonstrating that complex landscape dynamics involving cyclic permafrost aggradation and thermokarst lake formation occurred over stadial-interstadial as well as glacial-interglacial time periods. High values of Picea pollen and the presence of Larix pollen in sediments dated to 50-40 ka BP strongly suggest the presence of forest or woodland early in MIS 3; the trees grew within a vegetation matrix dominated by grass and sedge, and there is indirect evidence of grazing animals. Thus the interstadial ecosystem was different in structure and composition from the Holocene or from the preceding Last Interglacial period. An early Holocene warm period is indicated by renewed thermokarst lake formation and a range of fossil taxa. Multiple extralimital plant taxa suggest mean July temperatures above modern values. The local presence of spruce during the early Holocene warm interval is evident from a radiocarbon-dated spruce macrofossil remain and indicates significant range extension far beyond the modern tree line. The first direct evidence of spruce in Northwest Alaska during the early Holocene has implications for the presence of forest refugia in Central Beringia and previously assumed routes and timing of post-glacial forest expansion in Alaska.  2012 Elsevier Ltd." ;

Accurate projections of future change depend on anticipating the response of the Arctic climate system to forcing, and understanding how the response to human forcing will interact with natural climate variations. The Svalbard Archipelago occupies an important location for studying patterns and causes of Arctic climate variability; however, available paleoclimate records from Svalbard are of restricted use due to limitations of existing climate proxies. Here we present a sub-decadal- to multidecadal-scale record of summer temperature for the past 1800 yr from lake sediments of Kongressvatnet on West Spitsbergen, Svalbard, based on the first instrumental calibration of the alkenone paleothermometer. The age model for the High Arctic lake sediments is based on 210Pb, plutonium activity, and the first application of tephrochronology to lake sediments in this region. We find that the summer warmth of the past 50 yr recorded in both the instrumental and alkenone records was unmatched in West Spitsbergen in the course of the past 1800 yr, including during the Medieval Climate Anomaly, and that summers during the Little Ice Age (LIA) of the 18th and 19th centuries on Svalbard were not particularly cold, even though glaciers occupied their maximum Holocene extent. Our results suggest that increased wintertime precipitation, rather than cold temperatures, was responsible for LIA glaciations on Svalbard and that increased heat transport into the Arctic via the West Spitsbergen Current began ca. A.D. 1600." ;

Here we present a continuous, first-of-its-kind 1.3-My record of continental hydroclimate and lake-level variability derived from drill core data from Lake Malawi, East Africa (9-15 S). Over the Quaternary, we observe dramatic shifts in effective moisture, resulting in large-scale changes in one of the world's largest lakes and most diverse freshwater ecosystems. Results show evidence for 24 lake level drops of more than 200 m during the Late Quaternary, including 15 lowstands when water levels were more than 400 m lower than modern. A dramatic shift is observed at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after 800,000 years ago. Before 800 ka, lake levels were lower, indicating a climate drier than today, and water levels changed frequently. Following the MPT high-amplitude lake level variations dominate the record. From 800 to 100 ka, a deep, often overfilled lake occupied the basin, indicating a wetter climate, but these highstands were interrupted by prolonged intervals of extreme drought. Periods of high lake level are observed during times of high eccentricity. The extreme hydroclimate variability exerted a profound influence on the Lake Malawi endemic cichlid fish species flock; the geographically extensive habitat reconfiguration provided novel ecological opportunities, enabling new populations to differentiate rapidly to distinct species." ;

A better understanding of past periods indicative of permafrost degradation and aggradation is important for predicting the future response of Arctic landscapes to climate change. Here, we used a multi-proxy approach to analyse a~4m long sediment core from a drained thermokarst lake basin on the northern Seward Peninsula in western Arctic Alaska (USA). Sedimentological, biogeochemical, geochronological, micropalaeontological (ostracoda, testate amoebae) and tephra analyses were used to determine the long-term environmental Early-Wisconsin to Holocene history preserved in our core for central Beringia. Yedoma accumulation dominated throughout the Early to Late-Wisconsin but was interrupted by wetland formation from 44.5 to 41.5ka BP. The latter was terminated by the deposition of 1m of volcanic tephra, most likely originating from the South Killeak Maar eruption at about 42ka BP. Yedoma deposition continued until 22.5ka BP and was followed by a depositional hiatus in the sediment core between 22.5 and 0.23ka BP. We interpret this hiatus as due to intense thermokarst activity in the areas surrounding the site, which served as a sediment source during the Late-Wisconsin to Holocene climate transition. The lake forming the modern basin on the upland initiated around 0.23ka BP and drained catastrophically in spring 2005. The present study emphasises that Arctic lake systems and periglacial landscapes are highly dynamic and that permafrost formation as well as degradation in central Beringia was controlled by regional to global climate patterns as well as by local disturbances." ;

The identification of a clear seismic image of a plume beneath Yellowstone is compelling evidence that the Miocene to recent volcanism associated with the Columbia Plateau, Oregon High Lava Plains, Snake River Plain, Northern Nevada Rift and Yellowstone Plateau represents a single magmatic system related to a mantle plume. A remaining enigma is, why do radiogenic isotope signatures from basalts erupted over the MesozoicPaleozoic accreted terrains suggest a plume source while basalts erupted across the ProterozoicArchean craton margin indicate an ancient subcontinental mantle lithosphere source? We show that ancient cratonic lithosphere like that of the Wyoming province superimposes its inherent isotopic composition on sublithospheric plume and/or asthenospheric melts. The results show that Yellowstone plume could have a radiogenic isotope composition similar to the mantle source of the early Columbia River Basalt Group and that the plume source composition has persisted to the present day." ;

Using 210Pb-dated sediment cores, we explored patterns of OC burial in 116 lakes spanning several ecoregions and land use regimes in Minnesota, USA during the past 150-200 years. Rates for individual lakes (across all time periods) range from 3 to 204g C m-2yr-1 (median 33g C m-2yr-1) and show strong geographic separation in accordance with the degree of catchment disturbance and nutrient enrichment. Climate and basin morphometry exercise subordinate control over OC burial patterns, and diagenetic gradients introduce little bias to estimated temporal trends. Median burial rates in agricultural lakes exceed urban lakes and have increased fourfold since Euro-American settlement. The greatest increase in OC burial occurred prior to the widespread adoption of industrial fertilizers, during an era of land clearance and farmland expansion. Northern boreal lakes, impacted by historical logging and limited cottage development yet comparatively undisturbed by human activity, bury OC at rates 3X lower than agricultural lakes and exhibit much smaller increases in OC burial. Scaling up modern OC burial estimates to the entire state, we find that Minnesota lakes annually store 0.40 Tg C in their sediments, equal to 1.5% of annual statewide CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. During the period of Euro-American settlement (circa 1860-2000), cumulative OC burial amounted to 36 Tg C, 40% of which can be attributed to anthropogenic enhancement." ;

Analyses of calcium carbonate and organic matter concentration, magnetic susceptibility, titanium content, dry bulk density, and macrofossils are used to reconstruct water-level changes. The development of sand layers and deformed sediments at the deep-water core site (i.e. Core A-06) prior to ~10,900 cal yr BP suggest that lake level was lower at this time. Fine-grained organic sediment deposited from 10,600 to 9,500 cal yr BP indicates a rise in lake level. The formation of an unconformity at the shallow cores site (Core C-06) and the deposition of shallow-water calcium carbonate-rich facies at the Core A-06 site between ~9,500 and ~8,500 cal yr BP suggest lower lake levels at this time. Shallow-water facies gradually transition into a sand layer that likely represents shoreline reworking during an extreme lowstand that occurred at ~8,400 cal yr BP. Following this low water level, fine-grained organic-rich sediment formed by ~8,200 cal yr BP, suggesting deeper water conditions at core site A-06. Calcium carbonate concentrations are relatively low in sediment deposited from ~6,300 to 3,100 cal yr BP in Core A-06, indicating that lake level was comparatively higher during the middle and late Holocene. In general, results from this study suggest that the early Holocene was characterized by high P/E from ~10,500 to 9,500 cal yr BP, low P/E from ~9,500 to 8,400 cal yr BP, and return to higher P/E from ~8,200 to 3,100 cal yr BP." ;

The pattern of glacial erosion was to a large part controlled by constructive volcanic processes resulting in increased topographic relief after 2.5 Myr. Between 2.5 and 0.5 Ma valleys up to 400 m deep were excavated into the Tertiary basalts of eastern and south Iceland with an average erosion rate of 10-20 cm ka(-1). During the last 0.5 million years rates of erosion increased to 50-175 cm ka(-1), with an additional 200 to over 1000 m of valley excavation. Previous estimates of the rate of landscape erosion during the Holocene vary widely, from 5 to 70,000 cm ka(-1). We present new studies that define the rates of landscape denudation during the major part of the Holocene (the last 10,200 years): one based on the Iceland shelf sediment record, the other from the sediment record in the glacier-fed lake, Hvitarvatn. Both studies indicate average Holocene erosion rates of about 5 cm ka(-1) similar to our erosion rate estimate for 4-5 Ma old strata that has not been subjected to regional glaciation.

The forests in this study are located in northwestern Wisconsin on a sandy glacial outwash plain. Soils and local climate vary across the study area. We used the Natural Resource Conservation Service's Soil Survey Geographic soil database and published fire histories to characterize differences in soils and fire history around each lake site. Individual site histories differed in two metrics of past vegetation dynamics: the extent to which white pine (Pinus strobus) increased during the Little Ice Age (LIA) climate period and the volatility in the rate of change between samples at 50-120 yr intervals. Greater increases of white pine during the LIA occurred on sites with less sandy soils (R2=0.45, P < 0.0163) and on sites with relatively warmer and drier local climate (R2=0.55, P < 0.0056). Volatility in the rate of change between samples was positively associated with LIA fire frequency (R2=0.41, P < 0.0256). Over multi-decadal to centennial timescales, forest compositional change and rate-of-change volatility were associated with higher fire frequency. Over longer (multi-centennial) time frames, forest composition change, especially increased white pine, shifted most in sites with more soil moisture. Our results show that responsiveness of forest composition to climate change was influenced by soils, local climate, and fire. The anticipated climatic changes in the next century will not produce the same community dynamics on the same soil types as in the past, but understanding past dynamics and relationships can help us assess how novel factors and combinations of factors in the future may influence various site types. Our results support climate change adaptation efforts to monitor and conserve the landscape's full range of geophysical features." ;

Shainin Lake is a weakly stratified lake fed by distant glaciers, whereas Allison Lake is more strongly stratified and fed predominantly by proximal glaciers. At Shainin Lake, sediment accumulation started in late June and reached its maximum in mid-August, just before lake mixing and during a period of low river discharge. The grain size of the sediment reaching the sediment trap in Shainin Lake was homogenous throughout the summer. At Allison Lake, pulsed sedimentation of coarse particles during late summer and early fall storms were superimposed on the fine-grained sedimentation pattern similar to that observed at Shainin Lake. These storms triggered underflows that were observed in the thermal structure of the lake and deposited abundant sediment. The sequencing sediment traps reveal a lag between fluvial discharge and sediment deposition at both lakes, implying limitations to interpreting intra-annual sedimentary features in terms of inflow discharge." ;

Longer-term records of climate near the ice sheet margin provide information about natural climate variability and can be used to understand the causes of past changes in the Greenland Ice Sheet. As a proxy for Holocene climate near the ice sheet margin, we reconstruct the fluctuations of Bregne ice cap in the Scoresby Sund region of central east Greenland. Bregne is a small ice cap (2.5km2 in area) and responds sensitively to summer temperatures. We employ a multi-proxy approach to reconstruct the ice cap fluctuations using geomorphic mapping, 10Be ages of boulders and bedrock and lake sediment records.Past extents of Bregne ice cap are marked by moraines and registered by sediments in downvalley lakes. 10Be ages of bedrock and boulders outboard of the moraines indicate that Bregne ice cap was within ~250m of its present-day limit by at least 10.7ka. Multi-proxy data from sediments in Two Move lake, located downvalley from Bregne ice cap, indicate that the ice cap likely completely disappeared during early and middle Holocene time. Increasing magnetic susceptibility and percent clastic material from ~6.5 to ~1.9calkaBP in Two Move lake sediments suggest progressively colder conditions and increased snow accumulation on the highlands west of the lake. Laminated silt deposited at ~2.6calkaBP and ~1.9calkaBP to present registers the onset and persistence of Bregne ice cap during the late Holocene. 10Be ages of boulders on an unweathered, unvegetated moraine in the Bregne ice cap forefield range from 0.74 to 9.60ka. The youngest 10Be age (0.74ka) likely represents the age of the moraine whereas older ages may be due to 10Be inherited from prior periods of exposure. This late Holocene moraine marks the second largest advance of the ice cap since deglaciation of the region at the end of the last ice age. The oldest moraine in the forefield dates to 2.6calkaBP. The fluctuations of Bregne ice cap were likely influenced by Northern Hemisphere summer insolation throughout the Holocene and abrupt late Holocene cold events.  2013 Elsevier Ltd." ;

In a relative sense, methanogenesis was a more important pathway for decomposition in bogs (8013% of CO2 production) than in fens (645.7% of CO2 production), but because fens contain more labile substrates they may support higher CH4 production overall. The concentration of CO2 produced from methanogenesis (CO2-meth) can be considered equivalent to CH4 concentration before loss due to ebullition, plant-mediated transport, or diffusion. Bogs produced slightly less CO2-meth than fens (2.91.3 and 3.71.4mmol/L, respectively). Comparing the quantity of CH4 present to CO2-meth, fens lost slightly more CH4 than bogs (892.8% and 825.3%, respectively) likely due to the presence of vascular plant roots. In collapsed permafrost wetlands, bog moats produced half the amount of CO2-meth (0.80.2mmol/L) relative to midbogs (1.60.6mmol/L) and methanogenesis was less important (426.6% of total CO2 production relative to 558.1%). We hypothesize that the lower methane production potential in collapsed permafrost wetlands occurs because recently thawed organic substrates are being first exposed to the initial phases of anaerobic decomposition following collapse and flooding. Bog moats lost a comparable amount of CH4 as midbogs (637.0% and 649.3%)." ;

We explored seasonal and interannual trends in 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) concentrations and the correlation of these data with rainfall and hydrologic data from 2000 to 2013. We also conducted a detailed study of cyanobacterial abundances and MIB during 2 hydrologically extreme years, a prolonged drought in 2007 followed by an extremely wet year in 2008. The goal was to assess whether cyanobacterial abundances and explanatory variables that are often correlated with cyanobacterial abundances were useful predictors of MIB concentration. From 2000 to 2013, mean annual rainfall was negatively related to mean annual MIB (r =-0.50, p = 0.08) and explained 25% of the variation in MIB. In 2007, MIB and cyanobacterial abundance were high, whereas in 2008, MIB and cyanobacterial abundance were low. The total N:total P (TN:TP) mass ratio was strongly related to MIB concentration during the drought and explained 44% of the variation in MIB concentration (r =-0.66, p = 0.003). Our results suggest that rainfall and the TN:TP mass ratio may be useful predictors for MIB in drinking-water reservoirs.  2014 by The Society for Freshwater Science." ;

The differences in apparent age between TOC, pollen, and carbonate fractions are consistent and in accord with the origins of these fractions. Comparisons among different fractions indicate that pollen sample ages are the most reliable, at least for the past 15,000 years. The post-glacial radiocarbon data also agree with ages independently estimated from aspartic acid racemization in ostracodes. Ages in the red, siliclastic unit, inferred to be of last glacial age, appear to be several thousand years too old, probably because of a high proportion of reworked, refractory organic carbon in the pollen samples. Age-depth models for five piston cores and the Bear Lake drill core (BL00-1) were constructed by using two methods: quadratic equations and smooth cubic-splinefits. The two types of age models differ only in detail for individual cores, and each approach has its own advantages. Specific lithological horizons were dated in several cores and correlated among them, producing robust average ages for these horizons. The age of the correlated horizons in the red, siliclastic unit can be estimated from the age model for BL00-1, which is controlled by ages above and below the red, siliclastic unit. These ages were then transferred to the correlative horizons in the shorter piston cores, providing control for the sections of the age models in those cores in the red, siliclastic unit. These age models are the backbone for reconstructions of past environmental conditions in Bear Lake. In general, sedimentation rates in Bear Lake have been quite uniform, mostly between 0.3 and 0.8 mm yr-1 in the Holocene, and close to 0.5 mm yr-1 for the longer sedimentary record in the drill core from the deepest part of the lake.

The event stratigraphy recorded in major differences in sediment composition match variations in regional summer insolation, thus confirming a new age model for this core, which suggests that it spans the last 250 ka BP. Four depositional units of contrasting lithological and biogeochemical composition have been distinguished, reflecting past environmental conditions associated with relatively warm, peak warm, cold and dry, and cold but more moist climate modes. A relatively warm climate, resulting in complete summer melt of the lake ice cover and seasonal mixing of the water column, prevailed during the Holocene and Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 3, 5.1, 5.3, 6.1, 6.3, 6.5, 7.1-7.3, 7.5, 8.1 and 8.3. MIS 5.5 (Eemian) was characterized by significantly enhanced aquatic primary production and organic matter supply from the catchment, indicating peak warm conditions. During MIS 2, 5.2, 5.4, 6.2 and 6.4 the climate was cold and dry, leading to perennial lake ice cover, little regional snowfall, and a stagnant water body. A cold but more moist climate during MIS 4, 6.6, 7.4, 8.2 and 8.4 is thought to have produced more snow cover on the perennial ice, strongly reducing light penetration and biogenic primary production in the lake. While the cold-warm pattern during the past three glacial-interglacial cycles is probably controlled by changes in regional summer insolation, differences in the intensity of the warm phases and in the degree of aridity (changing snowfall) during cold phases likely were due to changes in atmospheric circulation patterns.  2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

We present data on the valve chemistry (18O, 13C, Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca) of living Limnocythere inopinata, a common and eurytopic Holarctic ostracode species, and on simultaneously collected water chemistry data from 15 water bodies in western Mongolia. These selected lake and pond study sites provide a fair representation of the regional trend in solute evolution towards pronounced calcium depletion, which is further characterized by good correlation between Mg/Cawater and total dissolved solids. Ostracode valve chemistry analysis showed that the Sr/Ca ratio (Sr/Cavalve) correlates better with Sr/Cawater than Mg/Cavalve does with Mg/Cawater, perhaps because Sr/Ca is less affected by calcification rate and temperature. The difference in 18O between the collected valves and a hypothetical ostracode calcite formed during mid-summer reveals an overall coherent trend of evaporative enrichment during summer in the sampled perennial water bodies, whereas smaller and/or ephemeral water bodies appear to be stronger impacted by stochastic rain events. Among-lake variation in 13C likely reflects the regional gradient in aquatic productivity, and the uniform pattern of relatively small mean offset between the 13C of ostracode valves and of surface-water dissolved inorganic carbon suggests epibenthic molting behavior in a well-mixed littoral habitat. The observed patterns in water and valve chemistry further suggest that females of L. inopinata, in this particular climatic setting, molt to adult in early summer. This information on calcification time and environment contributes to more rigorous paleo-environmental interpretation of lake-sediment records of this common species in central Asia. Our results also suggest potential for quantitative salinity reconstruction based on ostracode Mg/Cavalve in western Mongolian lakes, however this needs to be constrained by insight in the local hydrology and hydrochemistry of the reconstruction site.  2011 Elsevier B.V." ;

Redundancy analyses enabled us to identify the main provenance of the studied proxies whereas stratigraphically unconstrained cluster analyses allowed us to distinguish the \"outsiders\" as result of anomalous XRF scanner acquisitions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to identify and isolate the main underlying environmental gradients that characterize the sedimentary infill of Lago Chungara. The first eigenvector of the PCA could be interpreted as an indicator of changes in the input of volcaniclastic material, whereas the second one would indicate changes in water availability. The chronological model of this sedimentary sequence was constructed using 17 AMS 14C and 1 238U/230Th dates in order to characterize the volcaniclastic input and the changes in water availability in the last 12,300 cal years BP. Comparison of the reconstructed volcaniclastic input of Lago Chungara with the dust particle record from the Nevado Sajama ice core suggested that the Parinacota volcano eruptions were the main source of dust during the mid and Late Holocene rather than the dry out lakes as has previously been pointed out. The comparison of the water availability reconstruction of Lago Chungara with three of the most detailed paleoenvironmental records of the region (Paco Cocha, Lake Titicaca and Salar Uyuni) showed an heterogeneous (and sometimes contradictory) temporal and spatial pattern distribution of moisture. Although the four reconstructions showed a good correlation, each lacustrine ecosystem responded differently to the moisture oscillations that affected this region. The variations in the paleoenvironmental records could be attributed to the dating uncertainities, lake size, lake morphology, catchment size and lacustrine ecosystem responses to the abrupt arid events.  2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

ns3:6beac4df\-cb4a\-32b8\-9df1\-5469557ce8dd	ns2:abstracttext	"Aeolian dust is rarely considered an important source for nutrients in large peatlands, which generally develop in moist regions far from the major centers of dust production. As a result, past studies assumed that the Everglades provides a classic example of an originally oligotrophic, P-limited wetland that was subsequently degraded by anthropogenic activities. However, a multiproxy sedimentary record indicates that changes in atmospheric circulation patterns produced an abrupt shift in the hydrology and dust deposition in the Everglades over the past 4,600 y. A wet climatic period with high loadings of aeolian dust prevailed before 2800 cal BP (calibrated years before present) when vegetation typical of a deep slough dominated the principal drainage outlet of the Everglades. This dust was apparently transported from distant source areas, such as the Sahara Desert, by tropical storms according to its elemental chemistry and mineralogy. A drier climatic regime with a steep decline in dustfall persisted after 2800 cal BP maintaining sawgrass vegetation at the coring site as tree islands developed nearby (and pine forests covered adjacent uplands). The marked decline in dustfall was related to corresponding declines in sedimentary phosphorus, organic nitrogen, and organic carbon, suggesting that a close relationship existed between dustfall, primary production, and possibly, vegetation patterning before the 20th century. The climatic change after 2800 cal BP was probably produced by a shift in the Bermuda High to the southeast, shunting tropical storms to the south of Florida into the Gulf of Mexico." ;

Four ground-water types were identified: (1) Ca-Mg-HCO3 water with 87Sr/86Sr values of ~0.71050 and modern tritium concentrations was found in the mountainous carbonate terrain of the Bear River Range. Magnesium (Mg) and bicarbonate (HCO3) concentrations at Swan Creek Spring are discharge dependent and result from differential carbonate bedrock dissolution within the Bear River Range. (2) Cl-rich groundwater with elevated barium and strontium concentrations and 87Sr/86Sr values between 0.71021 and 0.71322 was found in the southwestern part of the valley. This groundwater discharges at several small, fault-controlled springs along the margin of the lake and contains solutes derived from the Wasatch Formation. (3) SO4-rich groundwater with 87Sr/86Sr values of ~0.70865, and lacking detectable tritium, discharges from two springs in the northeast quadrant of the study area and along the East Bear Lake fault. (4) Ca-Mg-HCO3-SO4-Cl water with 87Sr/86Sr values of ~0.71060 and sub-modern tritium concentrations discharges from several small springs emanating from the Wasatch Formation on the Bear Lake Plateau.The 18O and 2H values from springs and streams discharging in the Bear River Range fall along the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL), but are more negative at the southern end of the valley and at lower elevations. The 18O and 2H values from springs discharging on the Bear Lake Plateau plot on an evaporation line slightly below the GMWL. Stable isotope data suggest that precipitation falling in Bear Lake Valley is affected by orographic effects as storms pass over the Bear River Range, and by evaporation prior to recharging the Bear Lake Plateau aquifers.Approximately 99% of the solutes constituting Bear Lake's pre-diversion chemistry were derived from stream discharge and shallow groundwater sources located within the Bear River Range. Lake-marginal springs exposed during the recent low lake levels and springs and streams draining the Bear Lake Plateau did not contribute significantly to the pre-diversion chemistry of Bear Lake." ;

However, the bulk sediment signal is dominated by within-lake processes, whereas the fossil grass epidermal record provides the terrestrial vegetation response to changes in available moisture. The direction of change is similar, but the magnitude and timing of response are different. During the terminal Pleistocene, the aquatic record shows a dramatic, flip-flop behavior (bulk sediment 13C: -4 to -32), while the terrestrial grass epidermis record is much more muted (13C shifts from -11 to -15). Furthermore, during the transition to the relatively moister conditions of the Holocene, a dominance of C4 plants persisted for at least 80000 years after limnological changes began. On the other hand, the epidermal isotopic record shows a much more dramatic response than that provided by the bulk sediment to the onset of drier, more seasonally contrasted conditions during the late Holocene. These results emphasize the need to consider varying response times of the biogeochemical systems that control the production of proxies, especially when attempting to correlate widely separated records based upon fundamentally different proxies.

Evidence from Lake El'gygytgyn, in northeast (NE) Arctic Russia, shows that 3.6 to 3.4 million years ago, summer temperatures were ~8C warmer than today, when the partial pressure of CO2 was ~400 parts per million. Multiproxy evidence suggests extreme warmth and polar amplification during the middle Pliocene, sudden stepped cooling events during the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition, and warmer than present Arctic summers until ~2.2 million years ago, after the onset of Northern Hemispheric glaciation. Our data are consistent with sea-level records and other proxies indicating that Arctic cooling was insufficient to support large-scale ice sheets until the early Pleistocene." ;

U/Th dating indicates speleothem growth commenced at 25 kyr BP (Present = year 1950) and extended to 11.6 kyr BP making this one of few European speleothem growing during the last glacial period. Rapid climatic fluctuations as Heinrich event 2 (H2) and Greenland Interstadial (GI-) 2 are well characterized in this record by more arid and cold conditions and by more humid conditions, respectively. Speleothem growth ceased from 18.2 to 15.4 kyr BP (the so-called Mystery Interval) likely reflecting the driest and potentially coldest conditions of this record, coincident with the 2 kyr duration shutdown of the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC). A major gradual increase in humidity and possibly in temperature occurred from 15.5 to 13.5 kyr BP, beginning in the Blling and culminating in the Allerd period. This gradual humidity change contrasts with more abrupt humidity shifts in the Mediterranean, suggesting a different climate threshold for Mediterranean vs. Atlantic margin precipitation.  2009 Elsevier B.V.

Sediments are composed of alternating clay and gypsum reflecting relatively wet and dry climate conditions, respectively. From ~85 to 48 ka, sediments were dominated by carbonate clay indicating moist conditions during Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 5a, 4, and early 3. The first gypsum layer was deposited at ~48 ka, signifying a shift toward drier hydrologic conditions and the onset of wet-dry oscillations. During the latter part of MIS 3, Peten climate varied between wetter conditions during interstadials and drier states during stadials. The pattern of clay-gypsum (wet-dry) oscillations during the latter part of MIS 3 (~48-23 ka) closely resembles the temperature records from Greenland ice cores and North Atlantic marine sediment cores and precipitation proxies from the Cariaco Basin. The most arid periods coincided with Heinrich Events when cold sea surface temperatures prevailed in the North Atlantic, meridional overturning circulation was reduced, and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) was displaced southward. A thick clay unit was deposited from 23 to 18 ka suggesting deposition in a deep lake, and pollen accumulated during the same period indicates vegetation consisted of a temperate pine-oak forest. This finding contradicts previous inferences that climate was arid during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) chronozone (212 ka). At ~18 ka, Peten climate switched from moist to arid conditions and remained dry from 18 to 14.7 ka during the early deglaciation. Moister conditions prevailed during the warmer Bolling-Allerod (14.7-12.8 ka) with the exception of a brief return to dry conditions at ~13.8 ka that coincides with the Older Dryas and meltwater pulse 1A. The onset of the Younger Dryas at 12.8 ka marked the return of gypsum and hence dry conditions. The lake continued to precipitate gypsum until ~10.3 ka when rainfall increased markedly in the early Holocene." ;

The limnological characteristics of this karstic lake, including its meromictic nature, relatively high surface area/depth ratio (surface area ~0.1 km2; z max = 30 m), and steep margins, facilitated deposition and preservation of finely laminated facies, punctuated by clastic layers corresponding to turbidite events. The robust age model is based on 17 AMS 14C dates. Slope instability caused large gravitational deposits during the middle Holocene, prior to 6 ka BP, and in the late Holocene, prior to 1,600 and 1,000 cal yr BP). Relatively shallower lake conditions prevailed during the middle Holocene (6,0003,500 cal years BP). Afterwards, deeper environments dominated, with deposition of varves containing preserved calcite laminae. Increased carbonate production and lower clastic input occurred during the Iberian-Roman Period, the Little Ice Age, and the twentieth century. Although modulated by climate variability, changes in sediment delivery to the lake reflect modifications of agricultural practices and population pressure in the watershed. Two episodes of higher clastic input to the lake have been identified: 1) 6901460 AD, coinciding with an increase in farming activity in the area and the Medieval Climate Anomaly, and 2) 17701950 AD, including the last phase of the Little Ice Age and the maximum human occupation in late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries." ;

The low-K tholeiitic basalts share major element, trace element, and isotopic characteristics with olivine tholeiites of the eastern Snake River Plain, and must have been derived by similar processes from similar sources. In contrast, the younger high-K alkali basalts share major element, trace element, and isotopic characteristics with plume-derived alkali basalts of ocean islands suites like Hawaii. We conclude that this abrupt transition reflects either or both the erosion of pre-existing mantle lithosphere in the wake of the Yellowstone-Snake River plume, or the depletion of this lithosphere in fusible components so that it no longer contributed to the overall mass flux of magma. The abruptness of the transition implies that it may have a catastrophic origin, such as lithospheric delamination caused by a Rayleigh-Taylor instability beneath the Idaho batholith." ;

This water-level record was derived from three different sources: (1) grain size variations in radiocarbon dated and reservoir corrected lacustrine sediments, (2) the altitudes and ages of paleo-shorelines within the basin, and (3) the results of hydro-balance modeling, providing important insights into the character of water level variations (abrupt or gradual) in the amplifier paleo-Lake Suguta. The results of these comprehensive analyses suggest that the AHP highstand in the Suguta Valley was the direct consequence of a northeastwards shift in the Congo Air Boundary (CAB), which was in turn caused by an enhanced atmospheric pressure gradient between East Africa and India during a northern hemisphere insolation maximum. Rapidly decreasing water levels of up to 90. m over less than a hundred years are best explained by changes in solar irradiation either reducing the East African-Indian atmospheric pressure gradient and preventing the CAB from reaching the study area, or reducing the overall humidity in the atmosphere, or a combination of both these effects. In contrast, although not well documented in our record we hypothesize a gradual end of the AHP despite an abrupt change in the source of precipitation when a decreasing pressure gradient between Asia and Africa prevented the CAB from reaching the Suguta Valley. The abruptness was probably buffered by a contemporaneous change in precession producing an insolation maximum at the equator during October. Whether or not this is the case, the water-level record from the Suguta Valley demonstrates the importance of both orbitally-controlled insolation variations and short-term changes in solar irradiation as factors affecting the significant water level variations in East African rift lakes.  2013 Elsevier B.V." ;

A zero-dimensional model was formulated to project the long-term accumulation of chloride in urban lakes receiving runoff from roads on which road salt is applied. Four model parameters and an initial concentration were obtained by calibrating the model with 5 years (2004-2008) of monthly salinity data from seven lakes in the Minneapolis/St. Paul Twin Cities Metropolitan Area of Minnesota, USA. Three of the seven lakes appear headed towards year-round volume averaged chloride concentrations above the 230-mg/L chronic standard for impairment to aquatic habitat. The two lakes with the lowest projected equilibrium concentrations of chloride have already reached equilibrium. One lake is projected to take an additional 40 years to reach equilibrium under current climate conditions and current road salt application rates. If road salt application rates are reduced in future winters, it is projected that the lakes will respond with noticeably lower chloride concentrations within 5 to 10 years. If road salt applications are discontinued altogether, chloride concentrations are projected to drop to natural levels within 10 to 30 years in all seven lakes. A reduction of application rates by 50% would result in annual volumetric average chloride concentrations below the chronic standard.  2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

Here we calibrate a new organic geochemical proxy for lake temperature, and present a 45-yr-resolution temperature record from Hurleg Lake at the eastern margin of the ACA in the northern Tibetan Plateau. Combination with other proxy data from the same samples reveals a distinct warmdry climate association throughout the record, which contrasts with the warmwet association found in the Asian monsoon region. This indicates that the climatic boundary between the westerly and the monsoon regimes has remained roughly in the same place throughout the Holocene, at least near our study site. Six millennial-scale cold events are found within the past 9000 yr, which approximately coincide with previously documented events of northern high-latitude cooling and tropical drought. This suggests a connection between the North Atlantic and tropical monsoon climate systems, via the westerly circulation. Finally, we also observe an increase in regional climate variability after the mid-Holocene, which we relate to changes in vegetation (forest) cover in the monsoon region through a land-surface albedo feedback." ;

Paleoenvironmental data are abundant in these sediments, but are of limited value without adequate age controls. With the advent of accelerator-mass spectrometer (AMS) radiocarbon dating, it is now possible to date these paleolacustrine sediments. AMS dates were obtained on sediment cores from the Bonneville, Franklin, and Lahontan Basins. In the Bonneville Basin, the AMS-based chronology compares well with other chronologies constructed from dated shore-zone features. In the Bonneville and Franklin basins, AMS dates delimit unconformities not apparent by other means. We found that dispersed organic carbon from sediments deposited during relatively freshwater intervals provided apparently reliable AMS radiocarbon dates. Carbonate microfossils from the Lahontan Basin also produced results that appear reasonable, while bulk carbonate yielded erroneous results." ;

These data are combined with published biogenic silica and water content analyses to produce a detailed palaeolimnological history of the lake over the past ca. 17.5 ka. Late Pleistocene desiccation produced a lake-wide discontinuity marked by a vertisol. Sediments below the discontinuity are characterised by relatively low TOC and HI values, and high C/N, 13C and 15N, reflecting the combined influence of abundant terrestrial plant material and generally unfavourable conditions for organic matter preservation. A thin muddy interval with lower 13C and higher HI and water content indicates that dry conditions were interrupted by a humid period of a few hundred years duration when the lake was at least 35 m deep. The climate changed to significantly more humid conditions around 15.2 ka when the dry lake floor was rapidly flooded. Abundant macrophytic plant debris and high TOC and 13C values at the upper vertisol surface probably reflect a marginal swamp. 13C values decrease abruptly and HI begins to increase around 15 ka BP, marking a shift to deeper-water conditions and algal-dominated lake production. C/N values are relatively low during this period, suggesting a generally adequate supply of nitrogen, but increasing 15N values reflect intense utilisation of the lake's DIN reservoir, probably due to a dramatic rise in productivity as nutrients were released to the lake from the flooded land surface. An abrupt drop in 13C and 15N values around 13.8-13.6 ka reflects a period of deep mixing. Productivity increased due to more efficient nutrient recycling, and 13C values fell as 12C-rich CO2 released by bacterial decomposition of the organic material was brought into the epilimnion. A weak drop in HI values suggests greater oxygen supply to the hypolimnion at this time. Better mixing was probably due to increased wind intensity and may mark the onset of the Younger Dryas in the region. After the period of deep mixing, the water column became more stable. TOC, C/N, 13C and HI values were at a maximum during the period between 10 and 4 ka, when the lake probably had a stratified water column with anoxic bottom waters. A gradual decrease in values over the last 4000 yrs suggest a change to a more seasonal climate, with periodic mixing of the water column. Rising sediment accumulation rates and a trend to more uniform surface water conditions over the last 2000 yrs are probably a result of increased anthropogenic impact on the lake and its catchment. Following a maximum at the time of the rapid lake-level rise during the terminal Pleistocene, 15N has remained relatively low and displays a gradual but consistent trend to lower values from the end of the Pleistocene to the present. TN values have risen during the same period. The lack of correlation between 13C and 15N, and the absence of any evidence for isotopic reservoir effects despite the rise in TN, suggests that the atmosphere, rather than the lake's dissolved nitrogen pool has been the principal source of nitrogen throughout the Holocene. The importance of atmospheric N fixation to Lake Victoria's nitrogen cycle thus predates by a very considerable margin any possible anthropogenic eutrophication of the lake." ;

This warming was associated with a massive addition of carbon to the ocean-atmosphere system, but estimates of the Earth system response to this perturbation are complicated by widely varying estimates of the duration of carbon release, which range from less than a year to tens of thousands of years. In addition the source of the carbon, and whether it was released as a single injection or in several pulses, remains the subject of debate. Here we present a new high-resolution carbon isotope record from terrestrial deposits in the Bighorn Basin (Wyoming, USA) spanning the PETM, and interpret the record using a carbon-cycle box model of the ocean-atmosphere-biosphere system. Our record shows that the beginning of the PETM is characterized by not one but two distinct carbon release events, separated by a recovery to background values. To reproduce this pattern, our model requires two discrete pulses of carbon released directly to the atmosphere, at average rates exceeding 0.9 Pg C yr<sup>-1</sup>, with the first pulse lasting fewer than 2,000 years. We thus conclude that the PETM involved one or more reservoirs capable of repeated, catastrophic carbon release, and that rates of carbon release during the PETM were more similar to those associated with modern anthropogenic emissions than previously suggested." ;

ns3:71315361\-e5fe\-3bf9\-a74c\-a8e96b69a466	ns2:abstracttext	"Many pre-Mesozoic records of Earth history are derived from shallow water carbonates deposited on continental shelves. While these carbonates contain geochemical proxy records of climate change, it is the stratal architecture of layered carbonate units that often is used to build age models based on the idea that periodic astronomical forcing of sea-level controls the layering. Reliable age models are crucial to any interpretation of rates and durations of environmental change, but the physical processes that actually control this stratal architecture in shallow water carbonates are controversial. In particular, are upward-shallowing stacks of carbonate beds bounded by flooding surfaces (parasequences) truly a record of relative sea-level change? The purpose of this study is to examine a tidal flat that is actively accumulating carbonate stratigraphy, and to determine the relative importance of tidal channel migration (poorly known, but investigated here) and Holocene sea-level rise (well-known) in controlling post-glacial parasequence architecture. This work represents a field study of peritidal carbonate accumulation at Triple Goose Creek, north-west Andros Island. By integrating surface facies maps with differential global positioning system topographic surveys, a quantitative relationship between facies and elevation is derived. Sedimentary facies are sensitive to elevation changes as small as 5 cm, and are responding to both internal (distance to nearest tidal channel) and external (sea-level rise) controls. The surface maps also are integrated with 187 sediment cores that each span the entire Holocene succession. While flooding of the Triple Goose Creek area should have occurred by ca 4500 years ago, preservation of Holocene sediment did not begin until 1200 years ago. The tidal channels are shown to be stationary, or to migrate sluggishly at up to 6 cm per year. Therefore, while the location of tidal channels is responsible for the modern mosaic of surface facies, these facies and the channels that control them have not migrated substantially during the ca 1200 years of sediment accumulation at Triple Goose Creek. Once the region was channellized, vertical and lateral shifts in facies, such as the landward retreating shoreline, expanding mangrove ponds and seaward advancing inland algal marsh, are driven by changes in relative sea-level and sediment supply, not migrating channels. While stratigraphic columns look different depending on the distance to the nearest tidal channel, the overall parasequence architecture everywhere at Triple Goose Creek records an upward-shallowing trend controlled by the infilling of accommodation space generated by post-glacial sea-level rise." ;

The development of a proglacial lake before 26calka BP demonstrates the onset of deglaciation before the global Last Glacial Maximum, similarly to other alpine glaciers in southern European mountains. Rapid deglaciation occurred at the beginning of the Greenland Interstadial GI-1e (Blling, 14.6calka BP). Following a short-lived episode of glacier re-advance (14.4-14.2calka BP, GI-1d), a climatic improvement at 13.9calka BP suggests the glaciers retreated from the lake basin during the GI-1c. Another glacier reactivation phase occurred between ca13.0-12.4ka, starting earlier than the onset of GS-1 (Younger Dryas). Rapid deglaciation during the Early Holocene (11.7-10.1calka BP) was followed by a period of higher river discharge (10.1-8.2calka BP). After 8.2ka, the Holocene is characterized by a general decreasing trend in humidity, punctuated by the driest phase during the Mid Holocene (ca6.8-4.8), a wetter interval between 4.8 and 3.3calka BP, and a relatively decline of rainfall since then till present, with a minor increase in humidity during some phases (ca1670-1760) of the Little Ice Age.Discrete silt layers intercalated in the organic-rich Holocene deposits reflect large flooding events of the Tera River (ca10.1, 8.4, 7.5, 6.2, 5.7-5.6, 4.6, 4.2, 3.7, 3.3, 3.1, 2.7, 2.5 and 2.0calka BP). Their synchronicity with a number of cold and humid events described in the Atlantic demonstrates a strong control of NW Iberian climate by North Atlantic dynamics at centennial-millennial scale. Comparison with Western Mediterranean records points to similar regional dynamics during the Holocene, although modulated in the NW Iberian Peninsula by the stronger Atlantic influence.  2014 Elsevier Ltd." ;

Our experiments show that grass cuticle, conifer wood and leaves of some broadleaved taxa all produce recognizable charcoal types that are preserved in sediments. We use the identification of charcoal morphotypes to enhance our interpretation of a previously published charcoal record from Ferry Lake, Wisconsin. The occurrence of the different charcoal morphotypes changed as the vegetation and fire regimes changed over the past 2300 yr. Charred grass cuticle was more common before 1300 cal. yr BP when small charcoal peaks were frequent and the pollen assemblage suggests that an open oak savanna surrounded the lake. Charcoal with bordered pits produced from burned conifer wood was more common after 1300 cal. yr BP, when red/jack pine pollen increased and the frequency of charcoal peaks decreased, suggesting a switch from a surface fire regime to one with less frequent crown fires. Our results suggest that stratigraphic changes in the occurrence of charcoal morphotypes can improve our understanding of past vegetation and fire regimes.  2007 SAGE Publications." ;

ns3:72c8dff7\-e181\-3329\-adaf\-76dec2da0495	ns2:abstracttext	"In order to better constrain the limnological impacts from recent climate change relative to those of the Holocene, we developed a high-resolution multi-proxy paleoenvironmental record from a small lake on eastern Baffin Island, Arctic Canada. Carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotopic compositions from sediment organic matter, algal pigments, and diatom assemblages are integrated to provide robust indices of paleoclimatic variability. In particular, the ratio between individual carotenoid pigments (lutein:diatoxanthin) reveals a shift in dominant primary production from green taxa (chlorophytes, higher plants, and bryophytes) during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) to brown taxa (diatoms and chrysophytes) over the mid- to late Holocene. Green pigment abundance appears most sensitive to mean summer temperatures, and their increased relative abundance in the past serves as an indicator of warm times. Regionally, the HTM occurred shortly after local deglaciation (10 ka), persisting until ~7 ka. This timing agrees with that revealed by chironomid assemblages and ice-core records elsewhere in the Canadian Arctic, but is significantly earlier than suggestions from palynology on Baffin Island. This study provides additional evidence that this discrepancy represents the ecesis for higher plant dispersal and colonization on distal, freshly deglaciated landscapes. Pigment and diatom data indicate that mid Holocene cooling began between 7 and 6 ka, intensifying after 3 ka. All proxies show pronounced change after 1.5 ka, with the greatest divergence from average Holocene values occurring during the Little Ice Age (LIA), supporting the growing consensus that the LIA was the coldest multi-centennial interval of the Holocene. In the twentieth century, most proxies, including sedimentary carotenoid ratios, abruptly returned to a similar state as the Holocene Thermal Maximum, while diatom species assemblages present a more muted response. This underscores that anthropogenic alteration of the Earth system has created conditions with no exact analog in the past 10,000 years. Collectively, these results add new information on the dimensions of Arctic lake responses to Holocene climate change, which in turn can be used to reconcile paleoclimate reconstructions from diverse proxies." ;

ns3:73bef6dd\-1ce6\-3e66\-aac5\-84caa7b64bea	ns2:abstracttext	"Groundwater dominated lakes are an important feature of many landscapes. Their sediments are a particularly valuable source of paleoenvironmental information in semiarid regions where perennial lakes may otherwise be scarce. Where groundwater and lake composition are favorable, carbonate mineral precipitation, evaporative concentration of lake water, and microbial processes can combine to strongly deplete dissolved Ca relative to influent groundwaters. The authigenic carbonate flux (ACF) can then become limited by water column cation availability and thereby be coupled to groundwater inflow rates and aquifer recharge. Here we analyze sedimentary records from two marl-producing, groundwater-controlled lakes and demonstrate a link between one-dimensional ACF and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), a measure of land surface wetness. In a restricted outflow lake with high-carbonate alkalinity, ACF is enhanced during historically wet climatic periods in response to increased aquifer recharge rates. ACF in this lake declines during droughts. A neighboring dilute lake with a high rate of groundwater outflow shows comparatively weak coupling between ACF and PDSI history. Ionic chemistry, carbonate mineral equilibria, and 13C patterns of dissolved inorganic carbon show that the sensitivity of the ACF signal depends on the degree of evaporative evolution of lake water and the mineral saturation state of the water column under conditions of stratification and ice cover.

Coeval changes in the oceanic circulation of the North Atlantic imply freshwater forcing. However, the source, magnitude, and routing of meltwater have remained unknown. Located in central North America, Lake Superior is a key site for regulating the outflow of glacial meltwater to the oceans. Here, we show evidence for an ~45-meter rapid lake-level fall in this basin, centered on 9300 calibrated years before the present, due to the failure of a glacial drift dam on the southeast corner of the lake.

The role of climate changes in recent vegetation shifts has commonly been rejected without proper assessment. A palynological study of a long sediment core from Raraku Lake documents the vegetation dynamics for the last 34 ka and investigates their driving forces, particularly the effects of climate variability on vegetation changes. Significant relationships between pollen assemblage changes and sedimentary and geochemical proxies demonstrate the rapid response of vegetation to lake crater basin hydrology and climatic changes. The lake surroundings were occupied by an open mixed palm grove during the Last Glacial period. Poaceae and Sophora increased at the expense of palms and Triumfetta, and Coprosma practically disappeared, in response to slightly wetter and/or colder climate during the Last Glacial Maximum. Palms and Triumfetta thrived in a warmer and/or drier climate during the deglaciation. Minor vegetation changes (a slight increase in Sophora and a drop in Asteraceae and Poaceae) occurred between 13.2 and 11.8 cal. ka BP and can be related to rapid changes in the Younger Dryas chronozone. The increase in herbaceous taxa indicates a gradual shallowing of the lake and development of a mire during the Holocene, caused by sediment infilling and warmer and drier climate. Relatively rapid vegetation changes in the Holocene were caused by climate and by plant succession on the expanding mire. The rates of vegetation change observed in the mire were similar to those at the initial stages of human impact identified in a previous study. These results reveal significant vegetation changes prior to human presence, due to the interplay of climate variations (temperature and moisture), changes in lake basin form by infilling and intrinsic dynamics of plant succession. Hence, the potential contribution of these factors in vegetation shifts during the period of human presence should not be neglected." ;

We analyze the precision and accuracy of 15 AMS 14C ages of plant macrofossils obtained from a single ice-walled lake deposit. The semi-circular basin is about 0.72km wide and formed of a 4- to 16-m-thick succession of loess and lacustrine sediment inset into till. The assayed material was leaves, buds and stems of Salix herbacea (snowbed willow). The pooled mean of three ages from the basal lag facies was 18 27050 14C a BP (21 810cal. a BP), an age that approximates the switch from active ice to stagnating conditions. The pooled mean of four ages for the youngest fossil-bearing horizon was 17 77040 14C a BP (21 180cal. a BP). Material yielding the oldest and youngest ages may be obtained from sediment cores located at any place within the landform. Based on the estimated settling times of overlying barren, rhythmically bedded sand and silt, the lacustrine environment persisted for about 50 more years. At a 67% confidence level, the dated part of the ice-walled lake succession persisted for between 210 and 860cal. a (modal value: 610cal. a). The deglacial age of five moraines or morainal complexes formed by the fluctuating margin of the Lake Michigan lobe have been assessed using this method. There is no overlap of time intervals documenting when ice-walled lakes persisted on these landforms. The rapid readvances of the lobe during deglaciation after the last glacial maximum probably occurred at some point between the periods of ice-walled lake sedimentation.  2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd." ;

The longest core is 16.9 m long and spans approximately the last 27 500 yr of the lake's history. The oldest part of the sequence, from c.27 500 to 24 500 BP, is poorly understood, but seems to contain evidence of both high and low water levels. Between 23 000 and 19 500 BP the lake water was relatively dilute, but became more saline and alkaline between 19 000 and 16 000 BP when the lake level must have been low. Regressions of the lake are registered just before 13 500 BP, at c.3750 BP and after 2000 BP. Maximum lake level seems to have occurred between 9000 and 4000 BP. Grass cuticle fragments are prominent in sediments deposited before c.9000 BP, confirming the pollen evidence that grassland formerly existed around the Bosumtwi crater. -from Authors" ;

Sediment core T97-52V from Lake Tanganyika provides new insight into the timing and mechanisms behind East African climate change over the past 90+ kyr. This record is particularly important, because, other than a recently recovered scientific drill core from Lake Malawi, there are no other continuous, well-dated records from East Africa prior to 60 ka. The high resolution age model presented here provides a large degree of age certainty for the past 45+ kyr, and our suite of proxies allows a thorough examination of Lake Tanganyika's dynamics. From core stratigraphy and chemical analyses, we present evidence of a lake level drop greater than 400 m sometime prior to ~ 90 ka, much greater than that inferred for the LGM, suggesting a period of intense aridity sometime around 100 ka. Additionally, core T97-52 V preserves evidence of worm burrows detected by X-radiographic imagery as indicated by burrow-shaped deposits of iron oxide, indicating a shallow lake at the time of deposition of that material. Intermittently high lake levels between ~ 78 ka and ~ 72 ka developed at the same time as a weakened Asian monsoon and a pluvial phase in Northeast Brazil, suggesting a global reorganization of climate, possibly forced by a reduction in orbital eccentricity. Over the past 60 ka this core preserves the same events recorded in a core collected ~ 100 km away in the southern basin of Lake Tanganyika, including an unexplained increase in biogenic silica at ~ 37 ka, suggesting that this vast lake is responding coherently across both major bathymetric basins to regional and global climate forcing." ;

Here we use measurements of terrestrial peat thickness, bulk density, organic matter content, and basal radiocarbon age from permafrost cores, soil pits, and exposures in vegetated, drained lake basins to characterize regional lake drainage chronology, C accumulation rates, and the role of thermokarst-lake cycling in carbon dynamics throughout the Holocene on the northern Seward Peninsula, Alaska. Most detectable lake drainage events occurred within the last 4,000 years with the highest drainage frequency during the medieval climate anomaly. Peat accumulation rates were highest in young (50500 years) drained lake basins (35.2 g C m2 yr1) and decreased exponentially with time since drainage to 9 g C m2 yr1 in the oldest basins. Spatial analyses of terrestrial peat depth, basal peat radiocarbon ages, basin geomorphology, and satellite-derived land surface properties (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF)) from Landsat satellite data revealed significant relationships between peat thickness and mean basin NDVI or MNF. By upscaling observed relationships, we infer that drained thermokarst lake basins, covering 391 km2 (76%) of the 515 km2 study region, store 6.46.6 Tg organic C in drained lake basin terrestrial peat. Peat accumulation in drained lake basins likely serves to offset greenhouse gas release from thermokarst-impacted landscapes and should be incorporated in landscape-scale C budgets." ;

The moisture pattern in the Qaidam Basin is in opposite relation to tree-ring-based monsoon precipitations in the surrounding mountains, suggesting that topography may be important in controlling regional moisture patterns as mediated by rising and subsiding air masses in this topographically-complex region.

High-elevation snowpack is an important water storage that is carefully observed in order to meet increasing water demands in the greater semi-arid region. The purpose here is to consider Rocky Mountain water trends during the Holocene when known changes in earth's energy balance were caused by precession-driven insolation variability. Changes in solar insolation are thought to have influenced the variability and intensity of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and North American Monsoon and the seasonal precipitation balance between rain and snow at upper elevations. Holocene records are presented from two high elevation lakes located in northwest Colorado that document decade-to-century scale precipitation seasonality for the past ~. 7000. years. Comparisons with sub-tropical records of ENSO indicate that the snowfall-dominated precipitation maxima developed ~. 3000 and 4000. years ago, coincident with evidence for enhanced ENSO/PDO dynamics. During the early-to-mid Holocene the records suggest a more monsoon affected precipitation regime with reduced snowpack, more rainfall, and net moisture deficits that were more severe than recent droughts. The Holocene perspective of precipitation indicates a far broader range of variability than that of the past century and highlights the non-linear character of hydroclimate in the U.S. west.  2012 ." ;

Sediments deposited between 12 and 6 ka (radiocarbon) show extreme variations in composition, oxygen and carbon isotopic composition of bulk carbonate, carbon isotopic composition of organic matter, and magnetic susceptibility. These variations reflect changes in sources of moisture, regional vegetation types, precipitation-evaporation balance, ground- and surface-water influx, water residence time, erosion, lake productivity, water level, and water temperature. The total carbonate content of late Pleistocene sediments steadily increased from <20% at the base of the core to as much as 80% in sediments deposited between 11 and 9 ka. By about 8 ka, the total carbonate content of the sediments had declined to about 40% where it remained with little variation for the past 8 kyr, suggesting relatively stable conditions. There are marked increases in values of 13C and 18O in bulk carbonate, and 13C of organic matter, in sediments deposited between 10 and 6 ka as evaporation increased, and the vegetation in the watershed changed from forest to prairie. This shift toward more 18O-enriched carbonate may also reflect a change in source or seasonality of precipitation. During this early Holocene interval the organic carbon (OC) content of the sediments remained relatively low (2-3%), but then increased rapidly to 4.5% between 7 and 6 ka, reflecting the rapid transition to a prairie lake. The OC content fluctuates slightly between 4 and 6% in sediments deposited over the past 6 kyr. Like OC and total carbonate, most variables measured show little variation in the 13 m of sediment deposited over the past 6 kyr, particularly when compared with early Holocene variations. Although the magnetic susceptibility of this upper 13 m of sediment is generally low (<10 SI units), the upper six meters of the section is marked by striking 1 m cycles (ca. 400-500 yr periodicity) in susceptibility. These cycles are interpreted as being due to variations in the influx of eolian detrital-clastic material. Century-scale cyclic variations in different proxy variables for aridity and eolian activity from sediments deposited over the past 2000 yr in other lakes in the northern Great Plains, as well as in sand dune activity, suggest that aridity cycles were the dominant feature of late Holocene climate of the northern Great Plains.

Arid periods occurred prior to 2.9 cal. kyr BP and during 1.3-0.6 cal. kyr BP ('Mediaeval Climate Anomaly'). The most humid period occurred during 2.6-1.6 cal. kyr BP encompassing the late Iron Age-Iberian and Roman epochs. Two humid periods of lower intensity occurred between 0.8 and 0.6 cal. kyr BP (AD 1200-1400) and about 400 cal. yr BP (around AD 1600) coinciding with the onset of the 'Little Ice Age'. Humid conditions are synchronous with a decline in solar output and seem to correspond to atmospheric patterns similar to negative NAO phases. Arid conditions show better correlation with northern Africa climate evolution, suggesting a possible link to subtropical dynamics. The geographic location of Zonar Lake and the robust chronology provides an opportunity to improve our understanding of the climate evolution in mid latitudes during the late Holocene and to evaluate subtropical and high latitude factors in Mediterranean climate evolution.  2008 SAGE Publications." ;

EEM-PARAFAC identified four humic-like components and one protein-like component and the dynamics of each were evaluated based on their distribution with depth as well as across sites differing in hydrology and major biological species. The PARAFAC-EEM experiments were supported by dissolved organic carbon measurements (DOC), optical spectroscopy (UV-Vis), and compositional characterization by ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectroscopy (FT-ICR MS). The FT-ICR MS data indicate that metabolism in peatlands reduces the molecular weights of individual components of DOM, and oxygen-rich less aromatic molecules are selectively biodegraded. Our data suggest that different hydrologic and biological conditions within the larger peat ecosystem drive molecular changes in DOM, resulting in distinctly different chemical compositions and unique fluorescent fingerprints. PARAFAC modeling of EEM data coupled with ultrahigh resolution FT-ICR MS has the potential to provide significant molecular-based information on DOM composition that will support efforts to better understand the composition, sources, and diagenetic status of DOM from different terrestrial and aquatic systems." ;

Existing terrestrial records reveal spatially heterogeneous changes in Iceland's glacier extent, vegetation cover, and climate over the Holocene, but these records are temporally discontinuous and mostly qualitative. This paper presents the first quantitative estimates of temperatures throughout the entire Holocene on Iceland. Mean July temperatures are inferred based upon subfossil midge (Chironomidae) assemblages from three coastal lakes in northern Iceland. Midge data from each of the three lakes indicate broadly similar temperature trends, and suggest that the North Icelandic coast experienced relatively cool early Holocene summers and gradual warming throughout the Holocene until after 3 ka. This contrasts with many sites on Iceland and around the high-latitude Northern Hemisphere that experienced an early to mid-Holocene \"thermal maximum\" in response to enhanced summer insolation forcing. Our results suggest a heightened temperature gradient across Iceland in the early Holocene, with suppressed terrestrial temperatures along the northern coastal fringe, possibly as a result of sea surface conditions on the North Iceland shelf.  2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Geochemical variables were used as paleolimnological indicators and complement Zonar Lakes's paleoenvironmental reconstruction based on sedimentological and biological proxies, which define periods of increasing allochthonous input to the lake and periods of dominant autochthonous sedimentation. Chemical ratios identify periods of endogenic carbonate formation (higher Ca/Al, Sr/Al and Ba/Al ratios), evaporite precipitation (higher S/Al, Sr/Al ratios), and anoxic conditions (higher Mo/Al, U/Th ratios and Eu anomaly). Higher productivity is marked by elevated organic carbon content and carbonate precipitation (Mg/Ca). Hydrological reconstruction for Zonar Lake was based on sedimentological, mineralogical and biological proxies, and shows that lower lake levels are characterized by Sr-rich sediments (a brackish lake with aragonite) and S-rich sediments (a saline lake with gypsum), while higher lake levels are characterized by sediments enriched in elements associated with alumino-silicates (Al, K, Ti, Fe, trace and rare earth elements), reflecting fresher conditions. Geochemical indicators also mark periods of higher detrital input to the lake related to human activity in the watershed: (1) during the Iberian Roman Humid Period (650 BC-AD 300), around the onset of the Little Ice Age (AD 1400), during the relatively drier Post-Roman and Middle Ages (AD 800-1400), and over the last 50 years, due to mechanized farming practices. Heavy metal enrichment in the sediments (Cu and Ni) suggests intensification of human activities during the Iberian Roman Period, and the use of fertilizers during the last 50 years.  2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

This article reviews and updates the geophysical and paleoecological evidence for lake-wide desiccation and describes the environmental conditions that aquatic species likely experienced during the low stand. Lake Victoria was at its lowest between 18,000 and 14,000 calendar years ago, and it dried out at least once during that time. There is no evidence of remnant ponds or marshes persisting within the desiccated basin. If such features existed, then they would have been small, shallow, turbid, and/or saline, and therefore markedly different from the lake to which today's species are adapted. The existence of Lake Victoria's diverse endemic biota must be reconciled with the incontrovertible geophysical and paleoecological evidence of a ca. 15,000 year age for the lake, and not vice versa.  2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

Calculated optimum sample numbers (\"n\") for 18O and 13C in the ostracod Cytheridella ilosvayi and the gastropod Pyrgophorus coronatus vary appreciably throughout the cores in all three lakes. Variability and optimum \"n\" values were, in most cases, larger for C. ilosvayi than for P. coronatus for 18O measurements, whereas there was no significant difference for 13C measurements. This finding may be explained by differences in the ecology and life history of the two taxa as well as contrasting modes of calcification. Individual 18O measurements on C. ilosvayi in sediments from Lake Punta Laguna show that samples from core depths that have high mean 18O values, indicative of low effective moisture, display lower variability, whereas samples with low mean 18O values, reflecting times of higher effective moisture, display higher variability. Relatively dry periods were thus consistently dry, whereas relatively wet periods had both wet and dry years. This interpretation of data from the cores applies to two important periods of the late Holocene, the Maya Terminal Classic period and the Little Ice Age. 18O variability during the ancient Maya Terminal Classic Period (ca. 910-990 AD) indicates not only the driest mean conditions in the last 3,000 years, but consistently dry climate. Variability of 13C measurements in single stratigraphic layers displayed no relationship with climate conditions inferred from 18O measurements.  2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

This high-resolution paleolimnological information (annually resolved for most of the 20th century), including varve thickness measurements on a digital image, carbon stable isotopic composition of organic matter, and sedimentary component quantification, provides historical perspective to lake managers planning remedial measures with reference to the \"natural\" state of the lake, especially in regard to the perception that water quality has declined only in recent decades (i.e., in the late 20th century). The lake is at present eutrophic and oligomictic, with oxygen-depleted bottom waters enriched in dissolved solids relative to surface waters; an alum treatment has contributed to the problem of persistent stratification at the same time as it has reduced phosphorus and increased transparency in lake surface waters. The sedimentary record shows the lake's strong response to agricultural, recreational, and urban development in the watershed, gradual improvement beginning at the time of sanitary sewer installation in the 1960s, and only a minor additional response to a concerted remediation effort in the mid-1980s to 1990s. Indices of terrestrial inputs and algal productivity show evidence of a lake that was at its most heavily impacted during the mid-20th century, and which has improved in some respects since the 1960s.  2008 Copyright by the North American Lake Management Society." ;

This paleolimnological study clears up the controversy about the factors, which drove the lake to its present state. Lithological descriptions, ostracod paleoassemblages and Cyprideis torosa (Jones, 1850) shell morphological variations and geochemistry (18O, 13C and Sr/Ca) have been used to reconstruct the lake ecosystem evolution during the last two centuries. The sandy sediments at the bottom of LAntina core (63 cm) presented a typical assemblage of brackish water ostracods, with shell-derived 18O values, inferred salinity and Sr/CaWATER characteristic of waters with marine influence. However, 10 cm above, coinciding with a drastic change in lithology, ostracod palaeoassemblages and decreased shell 18O indicated a shift to freshwater influences. At the top of the sequence, inferred salinity suggests oligohaline waters and ostracods have almost disappeared. The early brackish conditions of Lake Albufera changed at the beginning of the 19th century when important hydrological modifications were undertaken for irrigation and started the major period of rice field expansion. Later, with the change of traditional rice farming to a more technological agriculture, together with increased domestic and industrial sewage inputs, the Albufera became a highly eutrophicated system 50 years ago. Eventually, the loss of macrophyte cover, cyanobacteria blooms and the increase of grazing by fish forced the loss of ostracod communities, currently almost inexistent." ;

High tropical species diversity has been linked to slow rates of climate change during the Quaternary, an assumption that lacks an empirical foundation. Thus, there is the need for quantifying the velocity at which the bioclimatic space changed during the Quaternary in the tropics. Here we present rates of climate change for the late Pleistocene and Holocene from Mexico and Guatemala. An extensive modern pollen survey and fossil pollen data from two long sedimentary records (30,000 and 86,000 years for highlands and lowlands, respectively) were used to estimate past temperatures. Derived temperature profiles show a parallel long-term trend and a similar cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum in the Guatemalan lowlands and the Mexican highlands. Temperature estimates and digital elevation models were used to calculate the velocity of isotherm displacement (temperature change velocity) for the time period contained in each record. Our analyses showed that temperature change velocities in Mesoamerica during the late Quaternary were at least four times slower than values reported for the last 50 years, but also at least twice as fast as those obtained from recent models. Our data demonstrate that, given extremely high temperature change velocities, species survival must have relied on either microrefugial populations or persistence of suppressed individuals. Contrary to the usual expectation of stable climates being associated with high diversity, our results suggest that Quaternary tropical diversity was probably maintained by centennial-scale oscillatory climatic variability that forestalled competitive exclusion. As humans have simplified modern landscapes, thereby removing potential microrefugia, and climate change is occurring monotonically at a very high velocity, extinction risk for tropical species is higher than at any time in the last 86,000 years." ;

If this model is correct, millennial-scale climate evolution should be antiphased between the northern and southern hemispheres, producing humid intervals in one hemisphere matched to aridity in the other. Here we show that Holocene climate trends were largely synchronous and in the same direction in the northern and southern hemisphere outer-tropical Andes, providing little support for the dominant role of insolation forcing in these regions. Today, sea-surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean modulate rainfall variability in the outer tropical Andes of both hemispheres, and we suggest that this mechanism was pervasive throughout the Holocene. Our findings imply that oceanic forcing plays a larger role in regional South American climate than previously suspected, and that Pacific sea-surface temperatures have the capacity to induce abrupt and sustained shifts in Andean climate." ;

Two sediment cores from shallow-water and deep-water environments were analyzed using sedimentological, geochemical, mineralogical, biological diatoms, pollen and charcoal content-, and radiometric techniques for absolute dating. The shallow-water sequence indicates a rapid evolution from an alluvial-influenced wetland prior to 7th century BC to a wetland during the Ibero-Roman Humid Period (BC 630  AD 465) and a deeper, carbonate producing lake during the Dark Ages Cold Period (AD 465-890). The deep-water core shows the transition from a more saline lake during the arid Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, AD 890-1300) to less saline, meromictic conditions, particularly since the onset of the Little Ice Age (LIA, AD 1300-1870). During the last 2.5 kyr, arid conditions occurred prior to 1st century AD, during the MCA and late 19th- mid 20th century while colder temperatures and relatively more humid conditions were more frequent during the the Dark Ages, particularly the 7th century AD and the LIA. The evolution of the lake also reflects changes in grazing and agricultural practices since the Roman Period associated to the exploitation of nearby salt mining. Periods of intense human pressure on the lake watershed occurred during the High Middle Ages (AD 890-1180) and the Modern Period (AD 1600-1830)." ;

Six sedimentary facies and four main sedimentary units have been defined after integration of sedimentological, mineralogical and geochemical analyses. The use of total sulphur content and sedimentary facies as paleohydrological proxies allows reconstruction of relative changes in lake level. The Estanya record shows a large increase in water availability after 9.2 ka, fluctuating lake levels and salinity during the period 9.2-4.2 ka; and generally higher lake levels after 1.7 ka. Periods of increased run-off and sediment delivery and less saline conditions occurred at 8.5-8.2, 6.7-5.9, and 4.9-4.2 ka. Dominant lower lake levels and concentrated waters during the period 4.2-0.8 ka were punctuated by a higher lake level, higher clastic input episode ca. 1.7-1 ka. Fluctuating, but higher lake levels occurred during the last 800 years. The main hydrological phases in Lake Estanya are coherent with Western Mediterranean and North Atlantic Holocene reconstructions, but they also show similarities with northern African records.  2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA." ;

Varve-thickness measurements track summer temperature recorded at Atigun Pass, located 41 km east at a similar elevation (r 2 = 0.31, P = 0.08). Results indicate that climate in the Brooks Range from 10 to 730 AD (varve year) was warm with precipitation inferred to be higher than during the twentieth century. The varve-temperature relationship for this period was likely compromised and not used in our temperature reconstruction because the glacier was greatly reduced, or absent, exposing sub-glacial sediments to erosion from enhanced precipitation. Varve-inferred summer temperatures and precipitation decreased after 730 AD, averaging 0.4C above the last millennial average (LMA = 4.2C) from 730 to 850 AD, and 0.1C above the LMA from 850 to 980 AD. Cooling culminated between 980 and 1030 AD with temperatures 0.7C below the LMA. Varve-inferred summer temperatures increased between 1030 and 1620 AD to the LMA, though the period between 1260 and 1350 AD was 0.2C below the LMA. Although there is no equivalent to the European Medieval Warm Period in the Blue Lake record, two warm intervals occurred from 1350 to 1450 AD and 1500 to 1620 AD (0.4 and 0.3C above the LMA, respectively). During the Little Ice Age (LIA; 1620 to 1880 AD), inferred summer temperature averaged 0.2C below the LMA. After 1880 AD, inferred summer temperature increased to 0.8C above the LMA, glaciers retreated, but aridity persisted based on a number of regional paleoclimate records. Despite warming and glacial retreat, varve thicknesses have not achieved pre-730 AD levels. This reflects limited sediment availability and transport due to a less extensive retreat compared to the first millennium, and continued relative aridity. Overall, the Blue Lake record is similar to varve records from the eastern Canadian Arctic that document a cool LIA and twentieth century warming. However, the occurrence and timing of events, such as the LIA and Medieval Warm Period, varies considerably among records, suggesting heterogeneous climatic patterns across the North American Arctic.  2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

Pollen, microcharcoal and magnetic susceptibility analyses of two sedimentary sequences from Lake Zirahuen in western central Mexico spanning the last 17,000 years provide evidence of a highly dynamic environment. During the late glacial Pinus forest developed around the lake, indicating cold and dry conditions. During the last deglaciation climatic amelioration was recorded at 13.5 ka, driving a strong and rapid change in vegetation composition and increase in lake levels. From the latest Pleistocene to early Holocene a hiatus, probably related to an erosive event, is recognized in the northern sequence. The central sequence spans the entire Holocene and reveals three periods of important ecological changes during the early Holocene. A first episode between 9.5 and 9.0 ka with a decrease in pine forest seems to have been associated with summer insolation increases. A second peak of forest change at 8.2 ka and was probably associated with the cold oscillation documented in the North Atlantic. A third abrupt change was evident from 7.5 to 7.1 ka with an anomalous plant community related to wetter Holocene climates and possible to a volcanic event. An episode of dry conditions was recorded from 4.5 to 4.2 ka, which was related to an increase in ENSO activity. Human influence over the landscape was evident from 3.5 ka to the present. The Zirahuen records offer a complex history of a landscape characterized by short and long term vegetation changes associated with factors ranging from global climate to local disturbances." ;

Here we present detailed lithologic and sedimentary fabric descriptions of the key sedimentary units, along with down-core physical properties data, down-core organic matter geochemistry (TOC, C/N, and [delta]13C data sets), and images and descriptions from core sections and from sediment smear slide microscopy. These data reveal a fundamental change in Lake Malawi's limnology and regional climate at ca. 60-70 ka. Prior to this time the lake was characterized by large-amplitude variations in lake level and water chemistry, but after 60 ka the lake remained comparatively high, and the central basin drill site accumulated mainly organic-rich, laminated sediments. Organic matter sources changed dramatically during the different lake stages. During major lake high stands, a mixed assemblage of algal (diatom-dominated), woodland and aquatic macrophyte (C4-pathway), and grassland (C3-pathway) organic matter was deposited, whereas during extreme low lake stages (water depths < 200 m), when saline, alkaline lakes persisted in the basin, sediments with minimal amounts of algal-dominated organic matter accumulated and were preserved." ;

Cores spanning the last 27.5 kyr of sedimentation in the lake show large oscillations in 13Corg PDB and 15Norg Air. The late Pleistocene record is particularly detailed, showing changes of ca. 20 in carbon and ca. 10 in nitrogen isotopic compositions. These variations are of complex origin. Although different in magnitude, major isotopic excursions in the two records are generally in phase and reveal the occurrence of two major dry intervals at and immediately following the Last Glacial Maximum. The Allerd-Younger Dryas period also seems to have been marked by generally dry conditions in this part of tropical West Africa. Nitrogen isotopic evidence suggests that during the period 9.2-3.2 kyr the lake had an extremely stable water column, probably due to the absence of a windy or cool, dry season, or both. Regular circulation of the water column recommenced during the late Holocene and has persisted until the present day.  1992." ;

Along its south shore, ongoing lake-level rise, accelerated erosion, and wetland loss are major environmental concerns to coastal communities. A better prediction of the future of this shore requires placing the instrumental lake-level records in a geological context. However, our knowledge of the late-Holocene history of the world's largest freshwater body remains fragmentary. Here we present a sedimentary record of late-Holocene relative lake-level changes by dating transgressive basal peats resting directly on a sandy substrate along a bathymetric gradient in Bark Bay Slough, Wisconsin. Our record shows a moderate lake-level rise at 1.40.2 mm/yr from about 2200 to 1250 cal yr BP as a result of relatively slow differential uplift of Bark Bay relative to the controlling outlet at Port Huron. The rise accelerated to 2.30.2 mm/yr at about 1250 cal yr BP when Sault Ste. Marie emerged as the controlling outlet, thereby separating Superior from Lakes MichiganHuron and giving rise to the modern hydrographic regime of the upper Great Lakes. The timing of this event in our record is about 1000 yr later than that postulated in most previous studies. Our results not only provide pertinent information for hydrological regulation, navigation operation, and infrastructural design in the upper Great Lakes, but also provide insight into freshwater wetland succession on flooded coasts." ;

These oscillations indicate a series of droughts from 4900 to 400 yr B.P. that define a drought period of 725 yr. This period may be correlated to variations in the Indian Ocean monsoons, as documented by similar periods in sea-surface salinity records from the northern Indian Ocean. The similarities in periodicity of the Lake Edward and Indian Ocean records may indicate that low-frequency variability within the Indian and Pacific Oceans dominates millennial-scale African moisture balance and the Holocene climate of the tropical Indian Ocean." ;

Location: Temperate forests of eastern North America, and the Eastern Woodlands cultural region. Methods: Ethnohistorical accounts, archaeological data, historical land surveys and palaeoecological records describing indigenous forms of silviculture and agriculture were evaluated across scales ranging from local (10<sup>0</sup> km) to regional (10<sup>2</sup> km) to produce a synthetic description of land-use characteristics. Results: Indigenous land-use practices created patches of distinct ecological conditions within a heterogeneous mosaic of ecosystem types. At all scales, patch location was dynamic, and patches underwent recurrent periods of expansion, contraction and abandonment. Land-use patches varied in their extent and persistence, and are broadly categorized as silvicultural (management of undomesticated woodland taxa) or agricultural (cultivation of domesticated taxa). Silvicultural patches persisted for centuries and extended kilometres to tens of kilometres around settlements and travel corridors. The dynamics of agricultural patches varied among groups, with persistence ranging from decades to centuries and extent ranging from less than a kilometre to tens of kilometres around settlements. Beyond patch boundaries, human impacts on ecosystems become indistinguishable from other drivers of environmental heterogeneity. These characteristics of patches are evident across scales and multiple lines of evidence. Main conclusions: Our findings challenge the view that prehistoric human impacts on vegetation were widespread and ubiquitous, and build on previous work showing these impacts to be more localized and heterogeneous by providing quantitative descriptions of land-use patch characteristics. Collaborative efforts that combine multiple data sources are needed to refine these descriptions and generate more precise measures of land-use pattern to further investigate the history of human impacts on the Earth system." ;

This study reports a clear signal for this event in the Venezuelan Andes, employing high-resolution palynological analysis of a well-dated sediment core from Laguna de Los Anteojos, situated around 3900 m elevation, within grass paramo vegetation. The lake is surrounded by some Polylepis forests which are close to their upper distribution limit. The section of the core discussed here is 150-cm long and dated between about 14.68 and 9.35 cal kyr BP, using a polynomial age-depth model based on six AMS radiocarbon dates. Between 12.86 and 11.65 cal kyr BP, an abrupt shift occurred in the pollen assemblage, manifested by a decline of Podocarpus, Polylepis and Huperzia, combined with an increase in Poaceae and Asteraceae. The aquatic pteridophyte Isoetes also decreased and disappeard, and the algae remains show their minimum values. Pollen assemblages from the Younger Dryas interval show maximum dissimilarity values compared with today's pollen assemblage, and are more similar to modern analogs from superparamo vegetation, growing at elevations 400-500 m higher. A lowering of vegetation zones of this magnitude corresponds to a temperature decline of between 2.5 and 3.8 C. During this colder interval lake levels may have been lower, suggesting a decrease in available moisture. The vegetation shift documented in Anteojos record between 12.86 and 11.65 cal kyr BP is comparable to the El Abra Stadial in the Colombian Andes but it differs in magnitude. The Anteojos shift is better dated and coincides with the Younger Dryas chron as recorded in the Cariaco Basin sea surface temperature reconstructions and records of continental runoff, as well as in the oxygen isotope measurements from the Greenland ice cores. When compared to other proxies of quasi-immediate response to climate, the time lag for the response of vegetation to climate is found to be negligible at a centennial scale. The Polylepis pollen curve is especially noteworthy, as it reproduces the overall pollen trends and matches well with paleoclimatic reconstructions based on other proxies. Hence, Polylepis might be used as a reliable paleoclimatic indicator in lake sediments close to its uppermost distribution boundary." ;

Our model is based on records from four lakes and incorporates the effects of erosion, dust deposition, and the authigenesis and diagenesis of the magnetic component of the sediment. Once checked against high resolution multi proxy climate records, which are currently being established for some of our study sites, it will allow us to use magnetic proxies to establish high-resolution climate reconstructions on a regional scale. Our model utilizes a combination of concentration-dependent parameters (magnetic susceptibility, IRM) and grain-size-dependent parameters (ARM/IRM, hysteresis parameters). Magnetic mineralogy is characterized by a combination of low-temperature measurements and S-ratios, and our magnetic measurements are complemented by XRD, LOI and smearslide analyses. During periods of forest growth within the watershed, deposition of terrigenous material is low and the sediment magnetic properties are characterized by low concentrations of mainly authigenic minerals (low values of IRM, high ratios of ARM/IRM). During the early to mid-Holocene dry period, deposition of terrigenous material increased due to intensified dust deposition and the erosion of lake margins caused by lowered water levels. Concentration of magnetic minerals increases (high IRM, ) and so does the grain-size of the magnetic fraction (low ARM/IRM). During the late Holocene, sediment magnetic properties depend on the varied position of the site with respect to the prairie-forest ecotone." ;

Approximately 80% of the molecular composition in surface porewater was maintained throughout the upper portion of the bog profile (0.17-2.50. m). The qualitative stability of the composition of the DOM was accompanied by a quantitative increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) with depth. The composition of DOM in the fen was significantly different at depth, with slightly varying DOC levels. Aromaticity index (AI) values were used to identify condensed aromatic and phenol-type compounds in the porewater of both peatlands. Surface bog and deep fen DOM had surprisingly similar molecular composition. Differences in enzymatic degradation rates via phenol oxidase in the bog and surface fen horizons, slower transport down the bog vertical profile and the presence of a stratum of Sphagnum-woody peat at depth in the fen are suggested as being responsible for the observed variations in DOM composition.  2010 Elsevier Ltd." ;

In this paper, we present a detailed paleoecological reconstruction of the developmental history of a kettle peatland in northern Wisconsin, USA (Fallison Bog) based on 21 coring locations and temporally constrained by 69 radiocarbon dates. This record of within-basin developmental history is compared to a regional dataset containing estimated ages of peatland establishment for 75 core samples collected from 37 depressional peatlands throughout the Great Lakes Region. Finally, our data are used to develop a spatially explicit model of whole-system carbon accumulation in Fallison Bog, which distinguishes between carbon pools stored in limnic sediments and peat deposits. Results indicate that peatland development in Fallison Bog was episodic and spatially complex. Peatland development was related to the morphology of the underlying basin and characterized by pulses of both terrestrialization and paludification. Major episodes of terrestrialization centered on 4980 and 3180 years before A.D. 1850 (cal yr BP), with less extensive episodes occurring around 3840, 1060, 670, and 410 cal yr BP. Extensive peatland area developed by paludification of shallow portions of the basin around 2040 cal yr BP. The timing of peatland development within Fallison Bog was correlated with the timing of peatland development in other depressional peatlands across the Great Lakes Region (r = 0.70), suggesting a common climatic driver. Comparison of peatland development in Fallison Bog and independent paleoclimate records suggested that both millennial-scale and sub-centennial-scale variability in moisture balance influenced spatiotemporal patterns of peatland development. Model results indicated that Fallison Bog accumulated 6655 t of carbon during the Holocene, with 66% of this total stored in peat deposits that have accumulated in only the last 5000 years. Collectively, model results and the strong correlation between the timing of within-basin and regional pulses of peatland establishment imply that depressional peatlands likely experienced climate-sensitive and episodic changes in carbon accumulation rates during the Holocene, and similar dynamics could be expected in response to ongoing and future climatic change." ;

In most exposures the unconformity between the Bonneville Alloformation and the underlying unit, herein named the Cutler Dam Alloformation, is marked by slight erosional relief and by a weakly to moderately developed buried soil, herein named the Fielding Geosol. In truncated profiles, the Fielding Geosol reaches a maximum of stage II carbonate morphology. Wood from near the base of the Cutler Dam Alloformation yielded a 14C date of >36,000 yr B.P. (Beta-9845). Alloisoleucine/isoleucine (aIle/Ile) ratios of Sphaerium shells from the Cutler Dam beds average 0.15  0.01 in the total hydrolysate, which is significantly greater than the average for Sphaerium shells of Bonneville age elsewhere in the basin. Therefore, the Cutler Dam Alloformation is older than 36,000 yr B.P., but much younger than deposits of the Little Valley lake cycle (140,000 yr B.P.?) which bear shells having significantly higher aIle/Ile ratios. The Cutler Dam Alloformation along the Bear River may be broadly correlative with marine oxygen-isotope stages 4 or 3. Fine-grained, fossiliferous, marginal-lacustrine facies of the Cutler Dam Alloformation are exposed at altitudes near 1340 m, and are probably the highest exposures of sediments deposited in the early or middle Wisconsin lake in the Bonneville basin." ;

We examine the persistence of compositional effects of fallout from the 7.63 kyr BP Mt. Mazama caldera-forming event and other tephra deposits in the micro-laminated abyssal sediments of Pettit Lake, central Idaho, which received ~50 kg m2 of Mazama tephra-fall material. Persistent post-depositional dominance of the Mazama material is reflected in elemental composition and grain size distribution and is related to lake hypsometry and the presence of a large in-lake sediment reservoir subject to remobilization. Decoupling of recycled clastic mineral material with Mazama compositional affinity from both biogenic matter and from clastic material derived from within the watershed is shown by coherence between dated primary tephras and a radiocarbon chronology." ;

To address this problem, sediment cores from shallow lakes connected to the Upper Paraguay River (PR) were analyzed and radiocarbon dated to track changes in sedimentary environments. Stratal relations, detrital particle size, multiple biogeochemical indicators, and sponge spicules suggest fluctuating lake-level lowstand conditions between ~11,000 and 5300. cal. yr BP, punctuated by sporadic and in some cases erosive flood flows. A hiatus has been recorded from ~5300 to 2600. cal. yr BP, spurred by confinement of the PR within its channel during an episode of profound regional drought. Sustained PR flooding caused a transgression after ~2600. cal. yr BP, with lake-level highstand conditions appearing during the Little Ice Age. Holocene PR flood pulse dynamics are best explained by variability in effective precipitation, likely driven by insolation and tropical sea-surface temperature gradients. Our results provide novel support for hypotheses on: (1) stratigraphic discontinuity of floodplain sedimentary archives; (2) late Holocene methane flux from Southern Hemisphere wetlands; and (3) pre-colonial indigenous ceramics traditions in western Brazil.  2012." ;

Here we take advantage of the presence of a riverine lake to use paleoecological techniques to quantify impacts of logging, European-style agriculture, urbanization and continued terrestrial disturbance on mass transport and water quality in the northern drainage of the Mississippi River. Two 2-m sediment-cores recovered in 1999 from Lake St. Croix, a natural impoundment of the St. Croix River, were dated using 210Pb and 137Cs, and analyzed for historical changes (c. 1840-present) in sediment magnetic susceptibility, inorganic and organic matter content, biogenic silica, fossil pigments, and diatom microfossils. Inorganic sediment accumulation increased threefold between the mid-1800s and present, whereas clear signs of eutrophication were only evident after the mid-twentieth century when biogenic silica accumulation increased sixfold, diatom accumulation rates increased 20- to 50- fold, and the diatom community shifted from predominantly benthic species to assemblages composed mainly of planktonic taxa. Similarly, fossil pigment concentrations increased during the 1960s, and diatom-inferred total phosphorus (DI-TP) increased from ~30 g TP l-1 c. 1910 to ~60 g l-1 since 1990, similar to historical records since 1980. Together, these patterns demonstrate that initial land clearance did not result in substantive declines in water quality or nutrient mass transport, instead, substantial degradation of downstream environments was restricted to the latter half of the twentieth century.  2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

Radiocarbon dates from three core sites constrain the timing of late Quaternary paleoenvironmental changes in the Central Andes and highlight the site-specific factors that limit the radiocarbon geochronometer. With the exception of mid-Holocene sediments, all cores are generally devoid of macrophyte fragments, thus bulk organic fractions are used to build core chronologies. Comparisons of radiocarbon results for chemically defined fractions (bulk decalcified, humate, humin) suggest that ages derived from all fractions are generally coherent in the post-13,500 yr BP time interval. In the pre-13,500 yr BP time interval, ages derived from humate extracts are significantly younger (300-7000 years) than ages from paired humin residues. Gross age incoherencies between paired humate and humin sub-fractions in pre-13,500 yr BP sediments from all core sites probably reflect the net downward migration of humates. Ages derived from bulk decalcified fractions at our shallow water (90 m) and deep water (230 m) core sites consistently fall between ages derived from humate and humin sub-fractions in the pre-13,500 yr BP interval, reflecting that the bulk decalcified fraction is predominantly a mixture of humate and humin sub-fractions. Bulk decalcified ages from the pre-13,500 yr BP interval at our intermediate depth core site (150 m) are consistently older than humate (youngest) and humin sub-fractions. This uniform, reproducible pattern can be explained by the mobilization of a relatively older organic sub-fraction during and after the re-acidification step following the alkaline treatment of the bulk sediment. The inferred existence of this 'alkali-mobile, acid-soluble' sub-fraction implies a different depositional/post-depositional history that is potentially associated with a difference in source material. While internally consistent geochronologies can be developed for the Lake Titicaca sequence using different organic fractions, mobile organic sub-fractions and fractions containing mobile sub-fractions should generally be avoided in geochronology studies. Consequently, we believe humin and/or bulk decalcified ages provide the most consistent chronologies for the post-13,500 yr BP interval, and humin ages provide the most representative ages for sedimentation prior to 13,500 yr BP interval. Using the age model derived from the deep water core site and a previously published isotope-based lake-level reconstruction, we present a qualitative record of lake level in the context of several ice-core records from the western hemisphere. We find the latest Pleistocene lake-level response to changing insolation began during or just prior to the Blling/Allerd period. Using the isotope-based lake-level reconstruction, we also find the 85-m drop in lake level that occurred during the mid-Holocene was synchronous with an increase in the variability of ice-core 18O from a nearby icecap, but was not reflected in any of the polar ice-core records recovered from the interior of Antarctica and Greenland.  2003 Published by Elsevier B.V." ;

Presented in this paper are three new paleoecological reconstructions from Lake Oswego, Porter Lake, and Warner Lake, Oregon, and portions of previous reconstructions from Battle Ground Lake, Washington, and Beaver Lake, Oregon. The reconstructions show that prior to Euro-American settlement vegetation and fire regimes were influenced by a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors. Battle Ground Lake shows a stronger influence from climate, while Lake Oswego, Beaver Lake, Porter Lake, and Warner Lake were more controlled by human activity. However, human-set fires were also modulated by regional climate variability during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age. Fire reconstructions from Battle Ground Lake, Lake Oswego, Beaver Lake, and Porter Lake imply that fires were infrequent in the Willamette Valley 200-300 years prior to Euro-American settlement. The decline of Native American populations due to introduced disease may have led to this reduction in fire activity. The prehistoric record from Warner Lake, however, indicates that fires in the foothills of the Cascade Range were more frequent than on the valley floor, at least until ca. AD 1800. The historic portions of the reconstructions indicate that Euro-American land clearance for agriculture and logging produced the most dramatic shifts in vegetation and fire regimes. All five records indicate that few fires in the Willamette Valley have occurred since ca. AD 1930, and fires today are predominantly grass fires." ;

The high sedimentation rate in karstic, meromictic Montcortes Lake (Catalan pre-Pyrenees) allows for a detailed reconstruction of the regional palaeoecology over the last 5,340 years using diatom analysis, aquatic pollen, sedimentological data, and historic documentary records. Results show marked fluctuations in diatom species assemblage composition, mainly between dominant Cyclotella taxa and small Fragilariales. We suggest that the conspicuous alternation between Cyclotella comta and C. cyclopuncta reflects changes in trophic state, while the succession of centric and pennate species most likely reflects changes in the hydrology of the lake. The diatom assemblages were used to identify six main phases: (1) high productivity and likely lower lake levels before 2350 BC, (2) lower lake levels and a strong arid phase between 2350 and 1850 BC, (3) lake level increase between 1850 and 850 BC, (4) relatively high lake level with fluctuating conditions during the Iberian and Roman Epochs (650 BC350 AD), (5) lower lake levels, unfavourable conditions for diatom preservation, eutrophication and erosion triggered by increased human activities in the watershed during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (9001300 AD), and (6) relatively higher lake levels during the LIA (13801850 AD) and afterwards. The combined study of diatoms, algae and pollen provides a detailed reconstruction of past climate, which refines understanding of regional environmental variability and interactions between climate and socio-economic conditions in the Pyrenees." ;

The sediments deposited at Lake El'gygytgyn (6730N, 1725E) in Far East Russia contain a 356 Ma record of climate variability. This study presents a high-resolution record of sediment colour change from Marine Isotope Stage 8 to 12 (ca 275 to 475 ka) and demonstrates the link between lake catchment processes and climate variability. The hue colour parameter, calculated from data collected via colour reflectance spectroscopy in the visible spectrum (380 to 720 nm), exhibits correspondence with global climate records. Determining the source of sediment colour changes was achieved through detailed mineralogical and sedimentological methods, and linked to colour changes through a series of colour sensitivity tests. Mineralogical data, measured by X-ray diffraction, reveal fluctuations in concentrations of clay minerals corresponding to colour changes. Further analyses of the clay mineral assemblages show no change in relative clay mineral abundances, yet demonstrate a lake catchment dominated by physical weathering processes. Using measured mineral abundances, reconstructions of sediment colour based on colour reflectance mineral standards link mineral and clay mineral content to overall sediment colour. Colour sensitivity tests demonstrate the ability of iron oxide minerals to stain sediments red. Additionally, colour sensitivity to organic matter content was tested, suggesting that organic content drives variability in the red portion of the spectrum and darkens the overall colour signal. Sediment colour is then ultimately linked to physical weathering of bedrock minerals, with small amounts of chemical weathering producing iron oxides during wet intervals. Fluctuations in the sediment colour reveal a high-resolution record of wet/dry cycles, and provide new information about wet periods for the Russian Arctic region not yet understood from other lake proxy records." ;

The history of sedimentation in Bear Lake is documented through the study of isotopic ratios of oxygen, carbon, and strontium, percent organic carbon, percent CaCO3, X-ray diffraction mineralogy, HCl-leach inorganic geochemistry, and magnetic properties on samples from three piston cores. Historically, the Bear River, the main source of water for Great Salt Lake, did not enter Bear Lake until it was artificially diverted into the lake at the beginning of the 20th century. However, during the last glacial interval, the Bear River did enter Bear Lake depositing red, calcareous, silty clay. About 18,000 years ago, the Bear River became disconnected from Bear Lake. A combination of warmer water, increased evaporation, and increased organic productivity triggered the precipitation of calcium carbonate, first as calcite. As the salinity of the lake increased due to evaporation, aragonite began to precipitate about 11,000 years ago. Aragonite is the dominant mineral that accumulated in bottom sediments of the lake during the Holocene, comprising an average of about 70 wt.% of the sediments. Aragonite formation in a large, cold, oligotrophic, high latitude lake is highly unusual. Lacustrine aragonite usually is found in small, saline lakes in which the salinity varies considerably over time. However, Bear Lake contains endemic ostracodes and fish, which indicate that the chemistry of the lake has remained fairly constant for a long time. Stable isotope data from Holocene aragonite show that the salinity of Bear Lake increased throughout the Holocene, but never reached highly evolved values of 18O in spite of an evaporation-dominated water balance. Bear Lake hydrology combined with evaporation created an unusual situation that produced large amounts of aragonite, but no evaporite minerals." ;

These data were used to reconstruct the Mid to Late Holocene history of this currently hyper-arid region, in order to address the question of whether the Mid Holocene environmental transition from a humid to a dry Sahara was progressive or abrupt. This study involved a suite of analyses, including petrographic and scanning electron microscope examination of thin sections, X-ray diffraction, X-radiography, granulometry, loss on ignition and magnetic susceptibility. The potential of micro-X-ray fluorescence core scanning was tested at very high resolution. Detailed microscopic investigation revealed the sedimentary processes responsible for the formation of the fine laminations, identified the season during which they were formed, and confirmed their annually rhythmic nature. High-resolution X-ray fluorescence core scanning allowed the distinction of each individual lamination over the entire record, opening new perspectives for the study of finely laminated sediment sequences. Geochemical and mineralogical data reveal that, due to decreasing monsoon rainfall combined with continuous and strong evaporation, the hydrologically open and fresh Mid Holocene Lake Yoa slowly evolved into the present-day hypersaline brine depleted in calcium, which has existed for about the past 1050 years. During the oldest part of the investigated period, Lake Yoa probably contained a permanently stratified lower water column that was nevertheless disrupted relatively frequently by mixing events. Deep-water anoxia became more stable because of increased salinity-driven density stratification. In parallel, the sediment grain-size proxies record a progressive increase of aeolian input in the course of the last 6100 years. Altogether, all geochemical and sedimentological indicators point to a progressive drying of the eastern Central Sahara, strengthening previous conclusions based on palaeoecological indicators." ;

Based on a detailed sedimentological analysis of cores, we describe and interpret 13 sedimentary subfacies grouped in 9 associations which characterize the following lacustrine subenvironments: clastic littoral (freshwater and saline), springs, microbial mats, bench slope, and pelagial (oxic, alternating oxic-anoxic, anoxic and hypersaline, and organic-dominated). Lateral distribution and vertical evolution of subfacies in our model are controlled by climate fluctuations, climate-related limnological parameters (lake level, TDS and brine composition, and redox conditions), and autocyclic processes (progressive infilling of the basin and higher sedimentation rate in the pclagial realm). Microbial and chemical processes govern deposition in this system, and meromixis plays a decisive role in lake dynamics. Phototropic bacterial plate communites at the chemocline dominated as pelagial organic producers during stable meromictic periods, whereas benthic microbial communities developed during mixed water periods. Water stratification during the Holocene was mainly controlled by three parameters: 1) basin morphometry, 2) lake level, and 3) differences in TDS values between mixolimnion and monimolimnion waters. Sedimentary facies analyses is a powerful descriptive and interpretative tool that greatly contributes to deciphering the high resolution paleoenvironmental information archived in lake sequences. Depositional and paleoenvironmental models provide a dynamic framework for integrating paleolimnological data and other proxy paleorecords. Medicine lake serves as a facies model for shallow, perennial hypersaline, meromictic lakes in modern and ancient lacustrine basins. The sediment sequence from Medicine lake cores is consistent with the general paleoclimatic evolution of the northern Great Plains since the retreat of ice sheets. Our study reveals a plethora of rapid fluctuations in the water cycle both during the middle and the late Holocene. These augment prior paleoclimate reconstructions based on diatom studies of the lower Holocene freshwater to saline transition and on pollen profiles which show little variability during the subsequent long prairie grass episode.  1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers." ;

Surface and underground waters show low to moderate saline content and an electrical conductivity in the range of 48.7 to 3090 mu S/cm. The lakes are related to a system of aquifers on the nearby volcano flanks and debris avalanche deposits of Parinacota. volcano. On the basis of delta O-18 and delta D isotopic composition and its correlation with the chloride content in Chungara and Cotacotani lake, spring, and Chungara river waters it is demonstrated that: a. Lake Chungara's waters show vertical and horizontal homogeneous isotopic composition, which indicates a good mixture of waters in the lake; b. an important part of the Cotacotani lake recharge feeding come from Lake Chungara, that flows laterally as groundwater; c. the groundwater that feeds the springs of the area has its main recharge in the spring-summer (October-March) precipitation. The high content of tritium (H-3) measured in spring waters of the area suggested a very recent recharge (last decades) of the aquifer system. The application of lumped parameter models to interpret the water residence time in the aquifer indicates that the piston flow model shows the best fit to the isotopic composition of Chungard-Cotacotani groundwater." ;

Our continuous 6000-year paleoenvironmental reconstruction from northern Chad shows progressive drying of the regional terrestrial ecosystem in response to weakening insolation forcing of the African monsoon and abrupt hydrological change in the local aquatic ecosystem controlled by site-specific thresholds. Strong reductions in tropical trees and then Sahelian grassland cover allowed large-scale dust mobilization from 4300 calendar years before the present (cal yr B.P.). Today's desert ecosystem and regional wind regime were established around 2700 cal yr B.P. This gradual rather than abrupt termination of the African Humid Period in the eastern Sahara suggests a relatively weak biogeophysical feedback on climate." ;

Continuous high resolution (1 mm) measurements of magnetic susceptibility yielded successions of pronounced lows and highs. Analyses of the rock-magnetic properties by low and high temperature runs of magnetic susceptibility, determination of hysteresis parameters as well as IRM acquisition experiments, yielded a dominance of PSD (pseudo-single domain) magnetite in intervals of high magnetic susceptibility, whereas, due to selective magnetite dissolution associated with anoxic Lake water and/or pore water conditions during times of enhanced deposition of organic matter, haematite dominates within low susceptibility intervals in terms of mass percentage. Here however, magnetic properties are still dominated by magnetite. Five AMS (accelerator mass spectromentry) C-14 ages, eight IRSL (infrared stimulated luminescense) ages together with preliminary pollen data suggest that variations in magnetite content reflect climatic variability of the last similar to300 ka with low (high) susceptibilities representing cold (warm) climates. This pattern, caused by a complex system of deposition, preservation or decomposition of organic matter and/or magnetic minerals, in turn can be correlated in detail to global climate archives such as the oxygen isotope records from Greenland ice cores and marine sediments, respectively. Thus, the sedimentary sequence recovered from Lake El'gygytgyn represents the longest continuous terrestrial climate record now available from the Arctic." ;

We reconstructed the Holocene vegetation and fire history of a small watershed to investigate the linkages among disturbance regimes, biogeochemical cycling and ecosystem structure. Specifically we asked: (i) how do compositional and structural changes in forest ecosystems modify fire regimes; and (ii) how do changes in fuel type and fire regimes impact biogeochemical cycling? Location: Comstock Lake, Wisconsin, USA, a small kettle lake at the modern prairie-forest ecotone in the Great Lakes Region of North America. Methods: We analysed a lacustrine sediment core from Comstock Lake, Wisconsin, for paleoecological proxies including charcoal quantity and morphotype, pollen composition, magnetic susceptibility, organic matter concentration and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. These paleoecological variables were used to reconstruct climate-mediated shifts in vegetation, fire disturbance and biogeochemical cycling during the last 13 200 calendar years before present (cal yr BP). Results: Forest composition in the landscape surrounding Comstock Lake varied among coniferous forest, deciduous forest and savanna over the Holocene. Independent of the vegetation changes, five distinct fire regimes were identified, ranging from frequent, low-intensity surface fires to infrequent, high-intensity crown fires. The main feature of our vegetation reconstruction is a shift from Pinus to Quercus forest that occurred between 10 000 and 11 000 cal yr BP. However, changes in fuel source and forest structure were apparently more important than shifts of species composition in determining fire regimes. We observed an inverse relationship between non-arboreal fuel sources and biomass burning throughout all five fire regimes. The biogeochemical consequences of fires were apparent during some, but not all regime transitions. Generally, the sediments were composed of relatively small clastic inputs from the catchment and mostly autochthonous organic sources. Conclusion: The location of Comstock Lake on the prairie-forest boundary meant that regional climate signals during the Holocene were filtered through vegetation. Both compositional changes in dominant tree taxa and structural changes in canopy openness influenced fire regimes." ;

Analysis of c. 1600 years of history chronicled in the sediments of South Center Lake, Minnesota, USA, revealed major environmental changes beginning c. 120 years ago coinciding with the initiation of industrialised agriculture in the catchment area. Population genetic structure, analysed using DNA from dormant eggs of the keystone aquatic herbivore, Daphnia pulicaria, suggested no change for c. 1500 years prior to striking shifts associated with anthropogenic environmental alterations. Furthermore, phenotypic assays on the oldest resurrected metazoan genotypes (potentially as old as c. 700 years) indicate significant shifts in phosphorus utilisation rates compared to younger genotypes. Younger genotypes show steeper reaction norms with high growth under high phosphorus (P), and low growth under low P, while 'ancient' genotypes show flat reaction norms, yet higher growth efficiency under low P. Using this resurrection ecology approach, environmental, genetic and phenotypic data spanning pre- and post-industrialised agricultural eras clearly reveal the evolutionary consequences of anthropogenic environmental change." ;

These parameters are ultimately driven by climate, sea level, and carbonate accumulation and dissolution. The authors propose a model that integrates climatological, geomorphological, and stratigraphic frameworks to understand processes of carbonate-hosted lake formation and limnological characteristics in modern day environments, with applications to carbonate lake sedimentary records. Fifty-two lakes from San Salvador Island and Eleuthera, Bahamas, were examined for water chemistry, basin morphology, conduit development, conductivity, and major ions. Using non-metric, multi-dimensional scaling ordination methods, the authors derived a model dividing lakes into either constructional or destructional formational modes. Constructional lakes were further divided into pre-highstand and highstand types based on whether their formation occurred during a marine regressive or transgressive phase. Destructional lakes are created continually by dissolution of bedrock at fresh/saline water interfaces and their formation is therefore related to changing climate and sea level. This model shows that lake formation is influenced by the hydrologic balance associated with climatic conditions that drives karst dissolution as well as the deposition of aeolian dune ridges that isolate basins due to sea-level fluctuations. It allows for testing and examining the climatic and hydrologic regime as related to carbonate accumulation and dissolution through time, and for an improved understanding of lake sensitivity and response to climate as preserved in the lacustrine sedimentary record." ;

A large proportion (> 80%) of the annual input to the lake occurred in the December to March rainy season. During this period, biogenic Si (BSi) made up 61% of Si input from rivers. Microscopic examination indicated that a large fraction of BSi was phytoliths, which likely originated from cultivated maize and terrestrial grasses. Over an annual cycle, river input made up approximately 25% of total Si input to the epilimnion, while 75% resulted from vertical exchange with Si-rich deep water. Due to its long hydraulic residence time, Lake Malawi retains nearly all of the Si that enters it. Despite high temperatures, a relatively high proportion (7 to 11%) of diatom production is permanently buried. A Si flux model is used to demonstrate that river discharge and vertical mixing can have similar effects on BSi burial rate over short time scales (one to two decades), but very different effects over longer time periods. This temporally dependent response must be taken into account when interpreting sediment records." ;

The accuracy of the calibration equation is tested by comparing the diatom-inferred salinity with documented salinity and water-level data recorded for the lake over the last 100 yr. The diatom-based reconstruction shows good agreement with the historical data, particularly in freshwater and at low to moderate salinities.

In the US, for example, billions of dollars have subsidized soil and water conservation practices in agricultural landscapes over the past decades. We used paleolimnological methods to reconstruct trends in sedimentation related to human-induced landscape change in 32 lakes in the intensively agricultural region of the Midwestern United States. Despite erosion control efforts, we found accelerating increases in sediment deposition from erosion; median erosion loss since 1800 has been 15.4 tons ha(-1). Sediment deposition from erosion increased >6-fold, from 149 g m(-2) yr(-1) in 1850 to 986 g m(-2) yr(-1) by 2010. Average time to accumulate one mm of sediment decreased from 631 days before European settlement (ca. 1850) to 59 days mm(-1) at present. Most of this sediment was deposited in the last 50 years and is related to agricultural intensification rather than land clearance or predominance of agricultural lands. In the face of these intensive agricultural practices, traditional soil conservation programs have not decelerated downstream losses. Despite large erosion control subsidies, erosion and declining water quality continue, thus new approaches are needed to mitigate erosion and water degradation." ;

Sedimentologic, mineralogic and nitrogen isotopic evidence suggest that struvite was deposited during nutrient-enriched eutrophication events within a Mg-rich lacustrine environment. The struvite layers are dispersed between 4650 and 8700 cal. yr BP, with particularly high frequency between 8068 and 8700 cal. yr BP. The youngest struvite layer dates to 2734 cal. yr BP. Key features of the struvite-forming events were (a) relatively low water stage and consequent elevated water salinity associated with the dry mid Holocene, (b) disappearance of most lakes and wetlands in the region, and (c) focused, but brief, visitations by large populations of migratory waterfowl. The lack of more frequent occurrence of struvite is ascribed to the rarity with which this combination of conditions was achieved, in combination with difficulty of preservation for this salt. 15N isotopes in struvite (mean 7.51) are heavy relative to 15N in sediment and also extremely uniform over time. The isotopes are interpreted to reflect a water-fowl waste source without extensive NH4 volatilizaton. The timing of the struvite events does not closely correspond to century-scale mid-Holocene drought cycles inferred from oscillating aragonite concentrations, although there is a weak preferred occurrence in the humid phase of these cycles. Thus the struvite events are ephemeral prairie features of this generally arid period but tend not to occur at precisely the most arid intervals.  2007 SAGE Publications." ;

We examine the relative importance of these processes during the middle to late Holocene through a study of an 8.5meter-long sediment record from the Albufera de Valencia (Spain). We combine sedimentological analyses with investigations into the palaeoecology, taphonomy and geochemistry (Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, 18O and 13C) of ostracod valves in order to assess the effects of sea-level changes, storm events and effective moisture on the evolution of a Western Mediterranean coastal wetland. The late Pleistocene sediments represent a subaerial environment, which was followed by a hiatus in deposition. The first Holocene unit (~8700-7500 calendar yr. BP) is composed of typical lagoon-barrier and backshore sediments, deposited when seawater intruded into the lake and the climate was arid. The upper part of the sequence (between 7500 and 3400 yr.) is characterized by two sedimentary units, which correspond to Holocene progradation phases and humid climate associated with an increased freshwater influx to the lake accompanied by several high-energy events (palaeostorms). Overall, the record shows that an arid climate prevailed in the western Mediterranean area between 8400 and 7600 yr. The main marine transgression and accompanying progradational phases occurred between 7000 and 3400 yr., which is confirmed by other studies of coastal evolution along the Mediterranean coast. The multiproxy reconstructions demonstrate that controls on sedimentation and palaeoecology in this Mediterranean coastal lagoon were complex.  2013 Elsevier Masson SAS." ;

Although the lack of terrestrial organic macrofossils and the presence of a significant 14C reservoir effect make radiocarbon dating of lake sediments very difficult, we propose the following palaeoenvironmental history. An initial shallow freshwater lake (ca. 22,000 14C years BP) disappeared during the extremely dry conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 18,000 14C years BP). That section is devoid of pollen. The late-glacial lake transgression started around 12,000 14C years BP, peaked in two phases between ca. 11,000 and < 9000 14C years BP, and terminated around 8000 14C years BP. Effective moisture increased more than three times compared to modern conditions ( 200 mm precipitation), and a relatively dense terrestrial vegetation was established. Very shallow hypersaline lacustrine conditions prevailed during the mid-Holocene until ca. 3600 14C years BP. However, numerous drying and wetting cycles suggest frequent changes in moisture, maybe even individual storms during the mid-Holocene. After several humid spells, modern conditions were reached at ca. 3000 14C years BP. Comparison between limnogeological data and pollen of terrestrial plants suggest century-scale response lags. Relatively constant concentrations of long-distance transported pollen from lowlands east of the Andes suggest similar atmospheric circulation patterns (mainly tropical summer rainfall) throughout the entire period of time. These findings compare favorably with other regional paleoenvironmental data.  2001 Elsevier Science B.V." ;

This paper compiles terrestrial and marine proxy data from sites along the northeastern Pacific margins and proposes that they indicate 1) suppressed ENSO conditions during the middle Holocene between ~8000 and 4000 cal BP with a North Pacific that generally resembled a La Nina-like or more negative PDO phase and 2) a climate transition between ~4200 and 3000 cal BP that appears to be the teleconnected expression to a more modern-like ENSO Pacific. Compared to modern day conditions, the compiled data suggest that during the middle Holocene, the Aleutian Low was generally weaker during the winter and/or located more to the west, while the North Pacific High was stronger during the summer and located more to the north. Coastal upwelling off California was more enhanced during the summer and fall but suppressed during the spring. Oregon and California sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were cooler. The Santa Barbara Basin had an anomalous record, suggesting warmer SSTs.Late Holocene records indicate a more variable, El Nino-like, and more positive PDO Pacific. The Aleutian Low became more intensified during the winter and/or located more to the east. The North Pacific High became weaker and/or displaced more to the south. Coastal upwelling off California intensified during the spring but decreased during the fall. Oregon and California SSTs became warmer, recording the shoreward migration of sub-tropical gyre waters during the fall, while spring upwelling (cooler SST) increased in the Santa Barbara Basin. The high-resolution proxy records indicate enhanced ENSO and PDO variability after ~4000 cal BP off southern California, ~3400 cal BP off northern California, and by ~2000 cal BP in southwestern Yukon. A progressively northward migration of the ENSO teleconnection during the late Holocene is proposed.  2010." ;

Light-white sediment laminae accumulated during short-term extraordinary diatom blooms whereas dark-green sediment laminae represent the baseline limnological conditions during several years of deposition. Diatom oxygen isotope ratios (18Odiatom) from 40 consecutive dark-green laminae, ranging from 11,990 to 11,450 cal year BP, show that a series of decadal-to-centennial drywet oscillations occurred. Dry periods are marked by relatively high isotope values whereas wet episodes are indicated by lower values. This interpretation agrees with the reconstructions of terrigenous inputs and regional effective moisture availability carried out in the lake but there is a systematic temporal disagreement between them owing to the non-linear response of the lacustrine ecosystem to environmental forcings. Furthermore, the 18Odiatom record tracks effective moisture changes at a centennial scale. Three major phases have been established (11,99011,800, 11,80011,550, and 11,55011,450 cal year BP). Each phase is defined by an increasing isotope trend followed by a sudden depletion. In addition, several wet and dry events at a decadal scale are superimposed onto these major trends. Spectral analyses of the 18Odiatom values suggest that cycles and events could have been triggered by both El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and solar activity. Significant ENSO frequencies of 79 years and 1517 years, and periodicities of the solar activity cycles such as 11 years (Schwabe), 23 years (Hale) and 35 years (Bruckner) have been recognised in the oxygen isotope time series. Timefrequency analysis shows that although solar and ENSO forcing were present at the onset of the Holocene, they were more intense during the late glacial period. The early Holocene might have been mainly governed by La Nina-like conditions that correspond to wet conditions over the Andean Altiplano." ;

We used visible reflectance spectroscopy to measure chlorophyll content (and its derivatives) in a sediment core from Kurupa Lake, north-central Brooks Range, Alaska, to reconstruct summer temperature and the number of annual non-freezing days over the past 5.7 ka. A calibration-in-time approach was used to convert downcore changes in chlorophyll content to the climate variables, and an ensemble approach was used to integrate age and calibration uncertainties. The strongest correlation (rmedian = 0.69, pmedian = 0.02, RMSEP = 1.9C) is for summer (June through September) temperature using the 20th Century Reanalysis Project dataset. The chlorophyll-inferred 3-year-mean summer temperature shows that the warmest century (3.02.9 ka BP) was about 3.0C (90% range of the ensemble members = 2.34.0C) higher and that the coldest century (1.41.3 ka BP) was about 5.5C lower (90% range = 7.6C to 5.0C) than during the reference period (AD 19611990). Century-to-century temperature changes over the past 5.7 ka at Kurupa Lake have been large (90% range = 2.8C to 3.1C shifts in centennial mean), including the shift between the 19th and 20th centuries, which was above the 90th percentile of temperature changes across all representations of the reconstruction. In contrast to most Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstructions, Kurupa Lake shows no overall millennial-scale cooling trend. We suggest that increased summer duration (by 4.3 days during the last 6 ka) along with no long-term increase in sea-ice cover over the adjacent Chukchi Sea counter-balanced the influence of decreased insolation intensity on the aquatic productivity in Kurupa Lake." ;

The reconstructed vegetation records are mostly independent of Bear Lake's hydrologic state and are therefore useful for identifying times when climate forcing contributed to lake changes. The Bear Lake pollen results indicate that significant changes in the Bear Lake vegetation occurred during the intervals 15,30013,900, 12,00010,000, 75006700, 67005300, 38003600, and 22001300 cal yr B.P. These intervals coincide with regional shifts in vegetation and climate, documented in pollen, isotope and biogeographic records in the Basin and Range region, suggesting that large-scale climate was the primary forcing factor for these intervals of change. Maximum aridity and warmth is indicated from 12,000 to 7500 cal yr B.P., followed by intervals of generally more mesic and cool conditions, especially after 7500 cal yr B.P." ;

Determining how much gas is present and where it is trapped is essential to understanding the role of northern peatlands on the global carbon cycle, particularly in regard to methane cycling. In this study, spatial variability in free phase gas content was estimated using ground penetrating radar (GPR) along a 1.4 km transect crossing distinct peat landforms including a bog crest, midslope lawn, and fen. Variations in gas content and distribution were observed in landforms crossed by this transect. Estimated gas content up to 25% by volume was observed in landforms dominated by woody surface vegetation. In areas of the midslope lawn, the estimated gas content was greater than 15%, while estimated gas contents between 0% and 7% were found in the fen. Changes in estimated gas content of up to 20% were observed over distances of 100 m across a transition between a stand of 10 m tall trees and an adjacent fen. The mean of the estimated errors in gas content is 1.3%, suggesting that these large changes in estimated gas content between landforms can be clearly determined using geophysical methods. A geophysical image of the distribution of free phase across this transect reveals evidence for gas storage in deep peat in intervals as thin as 0.35 m. These data support conceptual models based on accumulation and storage of free phase gas in deep peat." ;

Reconstructing the history of water pre1800 AD requires the use of proxy data. Lakes provide long-lived, high-resolution terrestrial archives of past hydrologic change, and their sediments contain a variety of proxies. This study presents geochemical and sedimentological data from Zaca Lake, CA (Santa Barbara County) used to reconstruct a 3000 year history of winter season moisture source (Dwax) and catchment run-off (1252000 m sand) at decadal resolution. Here we show that winter season moisture source and run-off are highly variable over the past 3000 years; superimposed are regime shifts between wetter or drier conditions that persist on average over multiple centuries. Moisture source and run-off do not consistently covary indicating multiple atmospheric circulation modes where wetter/drier conditions prevail. Grain-size analysis reveals two intervals of multi-century drought with less run-off that pre-date the epic droughts as identified by Cook et al. (2004). A well-defined wet period with more run-off is identified during the Little Ice Age. Notably, the grain size data show strong coherence with western North American percent drought area indices for the past 1000 years. As a result, our data extend the history of drought and pluvials back to 3000 calendar years BP in the CSWUS. Comparison to tropical Pacific proxies confirms the long-term relationship between El Nino and enhanced run-off in the CSWUS. Our results demonstrate the long-term importance of the tropical Pacific to the CSWUS winter season hydroclimate." ;

The chronology, based on 210 Pb and 15 AMS radiocarbon dates on terrestrial materials, indicates that 5 m of biogenic sediment accumulated following dune stabilization at ~10,000 cal yr BP. Previous studies on lake level and pollen were synthesized with these data to assess Holocene changes in hydrogeology and climate. Variability in groundwater level and flux has a strong control on lake level and are negatively correlated with the  13 C of organic matter produced within the lake. This relationship results from the input of groundwater with high pCO 2 and with dissolved inorganic carbon depleted in 13 C, which subsequently affects lake phytoplankton  13 C signatures. A rapid rise in lake level between ca. 11,000 and 9,500 cal yr BP coincided with stabilization of the dune field adjacent to the lake and expansion of vegetation around the lake, including white spruce. Organic  13 C values are relatively low and constant between about 10,000 and 6,000 cal yr BP, and then steadily increase until about 2,000 cal yr BP, suggesting a pattern of high followed by dropping lake levels generally consistent with results from core-transect studies. Higher-frequency fluctuations of 23  in  13 C are common, and suggest variability in aspects of the lake-carbon cycle over multi-decadal timescales. Recent trends in groundwater and lake level, river discharge, and precipitation suggest an important role for wintertime precipitation in the regional groundwater system. The unusual hydrology of this system relative to most other lakes studied for paleoclimate in this region provides a novel insight into different seasonal aspects of Alaskan paleoclimatology. The record is consistent with a general long-term decrease in wintertime precipitation, possibly accompanied by an increase in permafrost extent, over the Holocene." ;

Here we present a high-resolution analysis of diatom-inferred salinity from a site in the Northern Great Plains to reconstruct multidecadal- and centennial-scale climatic patterns during the early Holocene. The diatom-inferred salinity indicates a transition from fresh to highly saline conditions between c. 13400 and 7700 cal. yr BP, which suggests a major shift in climate from wet to dry conditions. The overall trend toward increasing salinity is interrupted by several freshwater intervals between c. 9800 and 7950 cal. yr BP, which may be the result of an increase in the frequency of monsoonal flow from the Gulf of Mexico. The early Holocene is considered to be a time of rapid change in climate and vegetation within the Holocene. Although rates of change in the Moon Lake diatom assemblages were high during parts of the early Holocene, in general the rate of change was as great or greater during the last two millennia. This finding may be the result of a generally directional change in climate in the early Holocene, in contrast to shorter-term fluctuations and little directionality in the late Holocene." ;

Strong stratigraphical patterns are shown by indirect gradient analyses of the data. The good correspondence between the stratigraphical patterns derived from macrofossil (Correspondence Analysis) and sedimentary and geochemical data (Principal Component Analysis) shows that macrofossil associations provide sound palaeolimnological information in conjunction with sedimentary data. The main taphonomic factors influencing the macrofossil assemblages are run-off from the catchment, the littoral plant belt, and the depositional environment within the basin. Five main stages during the last 34,000 calibrated years BP (calyrBP) are characterised from the lithological, geochemical, and macrofossil data. From 34 to 14.6calkyrBP (last glacial period) the sediments were largely derived from the catchment, indicating a high energy lake environment with much erosion and run-off bringing abundant plant trichomes, lichens, and mosses into the centre of Raraku Lake. During the early Holocene the infilling of the lake basin and warmer conditions favoured the growth of a littoral plant belt that obstructed terrigenous input. Cladoceran remains and Solanaceae seeds are indicative of reduced run-off and higher values of N and organic C indicate increased aquatic and catchment productivity. From 8.7 to 4.5calkyrBP a swamp occupied the entire basin. The increase of Cyperaceae seeds reflects this swamp development and, with oribatid mites and coleopteran remains, indicates a peaty environment and more anoxic conditions in Raraku. At around 4.5calkyrBP dry conditions prevented peat growth and there is a sedimentary hiatus. About 800calyrBP, peat deposition resumed. Finally, in the last few centuries, a small lake formed within the surrounding swamp. Evidence of human activity is recorded in these uppermost sediments.  2011 Elsevier Ltd." ;

The onset of European-style farming led to increased erosion, reflected in high values of concentration-dependent parameters such as magnetic susceptibility (k), Isothermal Remanent Magnetization (IRM), and Anhysteretic Remanent Magnetization (ARM). These high values are only partially due to increased supply of terrigenous material to the lake, and recent sediment contains an additional component of authigenic fine (single-domain) magnetite, most likely magnetosomes from magnetotactic bacteria. High organic productivity in the lake during the 1920s to 1940s drought increased this authigenic component resulting in highly magnetic fine-grained sediment. A comparison with older Holocene sediment from the same lake shows that, over time, most of the fine magnetic signal is lost after deposition, leading to decreases in magnetization and a bimodal grain size distribution of ultrafine, superparamagnetic grains and coarser multidomain particles, evident from measurements of ARM/IRM ratios, hysteresis measurements, and low-temperature analyses. The effects of dissolution and the superposition of climate and land-use signals complicate the use of recent sediments as modern analogs for sediment magnetic analyses.  2004 University of Washington.

The study also provides an important background for ongoing efforts to obtain paleoenvironmental records from sediment cores in the lake. The history of four seismic-stratigraphic units in the upper 20 m of section are inferred from the data, and the interpretations are generally consistent with previous interpretations of lake history for the past 2000 years, including a major lowstand at 1941 m. No shorelines below the previously documented major lowstand at 1941 m were found. A relatively steep slope segment, whose toe is at about 1918 m, and which occurs on the southern and western margins of the deep basin of the lake, is interpreted as the relict foreset slope of deposition from prograding western tributaries. This topography is unconformably overlain by a unit of interbedded tephra and lake sediments of variable lithology, which contains tephra of the North Mono (600625 cal yr BP) eruption in its upper part. The tephra-rich unit is overlain by a mostly massive mudflow deposit that is locally more than 18 m thick and that is distributed in a radial pattern around Paoha Island. The evidence suggests that within the past few hundred years, rapid uplift of Paoha Island through thick, preexisting lake deposits led to widespread slope failures, which created a terrain of disrupted, intact blocks near the island, and a thick, fluid mudflow beyond. As is common in mudflows, the mudflow moved up the depositional slope of the lake floor, terminating against the preexisting slopes, likely in multiple surges. Since about 1700 Common Era, fine-grained, well-laminated sediments have accumulated in the deep parts of the lake at anomalously rapid rates, probably driven by continued rapid, small-scale shedding of sediment from Paoha Island." ;

We conducted the first survey for alkenone biomarkers from 55 different lakes in the Northern Great Plains and Nebraska Sand Hills of the United States. Among those surveyed, we found 13 lakes that contain LCAs in the surface sediments. The highest concentrations of alkenones in sediments are found in cold (mean annual air temperature similar to 11 degrees C versus 17 degrees C in our warmest sites), brackish to mesosaline (salinity = 8.5-9.7 g/L), and alkaline (pH = 8.4-9.0) lakes with high concentrations of sodium and sulfate. The dynamics of stratification and nutrient availability also appear to play a role in LCA abundance, as early spring mixing promotes a bloom of alkenone-producing haptophytes. Four of the alkenone-containing sites contain the C-37:4 alkenone; however, we discovered an unprecedented lacustrine alkenone distribution in a cluster of lakes, with a total absence of C-37:4 alkenone. We attribute this unusual composition to a different haptophyte species and show that the sulfate:carbonate ratio may control the occurrence of these two distinct populations. We created a new in-situ temperature calibration for lacustrine sites that contain C-37:4 using a water-column calibration from Lake George, ND and show that U-37(K) is linearly correlated to lake water temperature (R-2 = 0.74), but U-37(K') is not. A number of lakes contain an unidentified compound series that elutes close to the LCAs, highlighting the importance Of routine GC-MS examination prior to using lacustrine LCAs for paleotemperature reconstructions.

Recently we reported that the formation of no-analog vegetation may have been linked to declines in Pleistocene megafaunal communities, based on pollen and spores from the coprophilous fungus Sporormiella at sites in Indiana and New York. We present a new, multi-proxy analysis from Silver Lake, OH, which 1) updates the radiocarbon chronology of a classic pollen record with a well-established zone of no-analog vegetation, 2) combines a new sub-centennial pollen record with charcoal, Sporormiella, and x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy analyses for an integrated record of landscape change before, during, and after the period of no-analog vegetation, and 3) replicates both the absolute and relative temporal patterns of landscape change at Appleman Lake, IN. At Silver Lake, the decline in Sporormiella at 13.9 ka BP was immediately followed by the formation of novel plant assemblages, as well as the highest-magnitude charcoal peak in the record. Increased Ca and Sr concentrations during the no-analog interval indicate either increased moisture, increased input of nutrients from deciduous litter, or both. The duration of the no-analog assemblages (13.911.8 ka BP) roughly corresponds to the period of peak insolation dissimilarity, but is more temporally constrained than previously reported in subcontinental-scale syntheses (1711 ka BP). We propose a hierarchy of controls on late-glacial plant communities, where biotic interactions such as megaherbivory mediate climate-driven vegetation change." ;

This early-Holocene decrease of almost 3 is interpreted as a result of a decline of almost 6C in the temperature of precipitation. The previous high temperature of much of the Lateglacial and the Preboreal (12000-9300 yr BP uncal.) may reflect warm summers related to greater insolation and warm winters caused by the influence of the Laurentide ice sheet on atmospheric circulation. After 8000 yr BP a disconformity interrupts the sequence, but after about 5000 yr BP the 18O and 13C are irregular because of a low lake level, as shown by the occurrence of littoral shells and woody detritus in the littoral core, and because of anthropogenic factors, as inferred from pollen indicators of forest disturbance and fanning found in both the littoral and offshore cores." ;

Modern limnological data show that Pumacocha 18Ocal reflects the average annual isotopic composition of the lake's surface waters (18Olw), and that 18Olw tracks the isotopic composition of precipitation (18Oprecip), which is largely controlled by the intensity of the South American summer monsoon (SASM). Based on these relationships we use down-core 18Ocal measurements as a proxy for 18Oprecip that varies with the intensity of SASM precipitation. Pumacocha 18Ocal increased rapidly between 11,200 and 10,300 yr B.P. from  14.5 to  10.5, reaching a maximum of  10.3 by 9800 yr B.P. After 9800 yr B.P., 18Ocal underwent a long-term decrease that tracked increasing Southern Hemisphere summer insolation, suggesting that enhanced SASM precipitation was linked to precessional forcing. Higher-frequency trends did not follow insolation and therefore represent other variability in the climate system. Millennial-scale trends from Pumacocha strongly resemble those from lower-resolution tropical Andean ice and lake core isotopic records, particularly the Huascaran ice core, and low elevation speleothems. These relationships suggest that tropical Andean isotopic records reflect variations in precipitation intensity related to precessional forcing rather than tropical temperatures. They also demonstrate a coherent pattern of SASM variability, although with differences between low elevation and Andean records during the late Glacial to Holocene transition and the late Holocene. Centennial and decadal SASM precipitation variability is also apparent. Reduced SASM rainfall occurred from 10,0009200, 70005000, 1500900 yr B.P. and during the last 100 years. Intensifications of the SASM occurred at 5000, 22001500, and 550130 yr B.P. with the amplitude of variability increasing after 2200 yr B.P. These periods may represent SASM responses to oceanatmosphere variability related to orbital and radiative forcing (e.g., El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the Intertropical Convergence Zone)." ;

Plant fossils discovered in Wyoming, United States, show that PETM floras were a mixture of native and migrant lineages and that plant range shifts were large and rapid (occurring within 10,000 years). Floral composition and leaf shape and size suggest that climate warmed by 5C during the PETM and that precipitation was low early in the event and increased later. Floral response to warming and/or increased atmospheric CO2 during the PETM was comparable in rate and magnitude to that seen in postglacial floras and to the predicted effects of anthropogenic carbon release and climate change on future vegetation." ;

Several calibrations have been put forth relating brGDGT distributions to MAAT using a variety of linear regressions, including the methylation (MBT) and cyclization (CBT) indices of brGDGTs, the relative abundances of the major, non-cyclized brGDGTs (MbrGDGTs), and best subsets regression (BSR) of the fractional abundances of the nine most common brGDGTs. However, these calibrations have rarely been applied to lake sediment cores to reconstruct temperatures and test the applicability of this proxy as a paleothermometer.We present an expanded East African lakes surface sediment brGDGT dataset based upon 111 lakes and examine three methods of calibrating brGDGTs to MAAT. These methods include recalculations of the East African lake MBT/CBT calibration and MbrGDGTs calibrations, as well as a new stepwise forward selection (SFS) calibration that uses the four combined brGDGTs that explain the most variance in temperature in our calibration set. We apply these new calibrations as well as five previously published lacustrine brGDGT calibrations to the brGDGT distributions of our surface sediment dataset and a 48. kyr sediment core from Sacred Lake, Mt. Kenya, producing the first brGDGT temperature reconstruction available from a small tropical lake. We compare the reconstructed temperatures to previously published paleotemperature records from East Africa to help us assess the performance of the brGDGT calibrations. We find that the SFS calibration has a consistently low root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) over the entire range of MAAT, while the MBT/CBT and MbrGDGT calibrations have relatively large RMSEPs, particularly between lakes with similar temperatures but variable pH. This suggests that these techniques do not properly deconvolve the temperature and pH signals recorded in the distributions of the brGDGTs. We further find that only the SFS calibration produces a credible reconstructed temperature history from Sacred Lake when compared to other last glacial maximum paleotemperature estimates from East Africa. Thus, we advocate for the use of the SFS calibration when reconstructing paleotemperatures from brGDGTs in East Africa.  2012 Elsevier B.V." ;

Mean size of the sortable silt (SS) varies measurably in sediments spanning the past 650 yr and covaries with the mass accumulation rate of terrigenous silt and clay (TMAR) over much of the interval. Most of the silt and clay is delivered to the offshore basin in benthic nepheloid plumes of unknown duration and frequency. TMAR appears to be related to annual rainfall (which is related to the North Atlantic Oscillation) because it roughly tracks the historical record of lake level that extends back to 1860. SS should be related to density or thickness of underflow, thus related to resuspension intensity or river flood loading. It also tracks lake level and regional wind strength as determined by National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Reanalysis.  2008, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc." ;

Shorelines provide evidence of precise lake levels, but they are infrequently preserved and are poorly dated. For cored sediment similar to that in the modern lake, grain-size distributions provide estimates of past lake depths. Sedimentary textures provide a highly sensitive, continuous record of lake-level changes, but the modern distribution of fabrics is poorly constrained, and many ancient features have no modern analog. Combining the three types of data yields a more robust lake-level history than can be obtained from any one type alone. When smooth age-depth models are used, lake-level curves from multiple cores contain inconsistent intervals (i.e., one record indicates a rising lake level while another record indicates a falling lake level). These discrepancies were removed and the multiple records were combined into a single lake-level curve by developing age-depth relations that contain changes in deposition rate (i.e., gaps) where indicated by sedimentological evidence. The resultant curve shows that, prior to 18 ka, lake level was stable near the modern level, probably because the lake was overflowing. Between ca. 17.5 and 15.5 ka, lake level was 40 m below the modern level, then fluctuated rapidly throughout the post-glacial interval. Following a brief rise centered ca. 15 ka ( = Raspberry Square phase), lake level lowered again to 15-20 m below modern from ca. 14.8-11.8 ka. This regression culminated in a lowstand to 40 m below modern ca. 12.5 ka, before a rapid rise to levels above modern ca. 11.5 ka. Lake level was typically lower than present throughout the Holocene, with pronounced lowstands 15-20 m below the modern level ca. 10-9, 7.0, 6.5-4.5, 3.5, 3.0-2.5, 2.0, and 1.5 ka. High lake levels near or above the modern lake occurred ca. 8.5-8.0, 7.0-6.5, 4.5-3.5, 2.5, and 0.7 ka. This lake-level history is more similar to records from Pyramid Lake, Nevada, and Owens Lake, California, than to those from Lake Bonneville, Utah.

Along its south shore, ongoing lake-level rise, accelerated erosion, and wetland loss are major environmental concerns to coastal communities. A better prediction of the future of this shore requires placing the instrumental lake-level records in a geological context. However, our knowledge of the late-Holocene history of the world's largest freshwater body remains fragmentary. Here we present a sedimentary record of late-Holocene relative lake-level changes by dating transgressive basal peats resting directly on a sandy substrate along a bathymetric gradient in Bark Bay Slough, Wisconsin. Our record shows a moderate lake-level rise at 1.40.2. mm/yr from about 2200 to 1250. cal. yr. BP as a result of relatively slow differential uplift of Bark Bay relative to the controlling outlet at Port Huron. The rise accelerated to 2.30.2. mm/yr at about 1250. cal. yr. BP when Sault Ste. Marie emerged as the controlling outlet, thereby separating Superior from Lakes Michigan-Huron and giving rise to the modern hydrographic regime of the upper Great Lakes. The timing of this event in our record is about 1000 yr later than that estimated in most previous studies, but our data complement and confirm the younger age of lake separation inferred using a different methodology. Our results not only provide pertinent information for hydrological regulation, navigation operation, and infrastructural design in the upper Great Lakes, but also provide insight into freshwater wetland succession on flooded coasts.  2013 Elsevier B.V." ;

The Lago Fagnano region, at similar to 54 degrees 30'S and similar to 68 degrees W, has experienced several phases of glacier growth and retreat since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We illustrate these phases using combined geomorphological, geophysical and coring surveys in Lago Fagnano itself, a similar to 105 km-long, E-W-oriented glacio-tectonic basin. We identify and map a complex set of submerged frontal, central and lateral moraines covered by lacustrine sediments using seismic stratigraphic analysis of multi-channel profiles imaging the sub-lake floor. We then combine these geophysical data with field observations and regional maps of similar structures around the lake to reconstruct the spatial behavior of the Fagnano paleo-glacier since the LGM. We interpret the preserved frontal moraines as having formed during at least 20 re-advance stages of the glacier within a long-term deglaciation interval post-LGM. Preliminary tephrochronological dating of a similar to 7.5 m long core indicates a step-wise deglaciation pattern comprising a final glacier re-advance stage at similar to 11.2 ka BP.

Error inherent in sediment core dating methods and uncertainty in climate data contribute to differences in model reconstructed and measured short-term (i.e., sub-decadal) sediment (i.e., endogenic and/or biogenic carbonate) 18O values, suggesting that model isotopic performance over sub-decadal time periods cannot be successfully investigated without better constrained climate data and sediment core chronologies. Model reconstructions of past lake surface elevations are consistent with estimates obtained from aerial photography. Simulation results suggest that precipitation is the strongest control on lake isotopic and hydrologic dynamics, with secondary influence by temperature and relative humidity. This model validation exercise demonstrates that lake-catchment oxygen isotope mass balance models forced with instrumental climate data can reproduce lake hydrologic and isotopic variability over multidecadal (or longer) timescales, and therefore, that such models could potentially be used for quantitative investigations of paleo-lake responses to hydroclimatic change.  2012 Elsevier Ltd." ;

However, little is known about the role of tropical peatlands in the global carbon cycle. We therefore determine the past rates of carbon storage and release in the Indonesian peatlands of Kalimantan and Sumatra - the largest global concentration of tropical peatlands - since 20 ka (kiloannum before present). Using a novel GIS (geographic information system) approach we provide a spatially-explicit reconstruction of peatland expansion in a series of paleogeographic maps.Sea-level change is identified as the principal driver for peatland formation and expansion in western Indonesia as it controls both atmospheric moisture supply and the hydrological gradient on the islands. Initiation of inland peatlands in Kalimantan was coupled to periods of rapid deglacial sea-level rise with rates of over 10mmyr-1 whereas coastal peatlands could only form after 7 ka when the rate of sea-level rise had slowed to 2.4mmyr-1. Falling sea levels after 5 ka led to rapid peatland expansion in coastal lowlands and a doubling of the total peatland area in western Indonesia to 131,500km2 between 2.3 ka and 0 ka. As a result of slow peatland expansion from 15 to 6 ka and rapid expansion afterwards the rate of annual carbon storage of all western Indonesian peatlands remained <1TgC yr-1 until 6 ka and then increased to 7.2TgC yr-1 by 0 ka. Associated with this rise in carbon storage was an exponential growth of the peat carbon pool from 0.01PgC by 15 ka to 23.2PgC at present, of which 70% is stored in coastal peatlands. In inland Kalimantan peatlands, falling sea levels together with increased El Nino activity induced an annual carbon release of 0.15TgC yr-1 from aerobic peat decay since 2 ka. Cumulative carbon losses from anaerobic decomposition do not seem to limit peat bog growth in the tropical peatlands of Indonesia. Carbon losses from Holocene peat fires are only known from the Kutai basin since 4.4 ka with an associated release of 0.1-3.6TgC per fire event, which never surpassed the contemporaneous annual C storage. The peatlands of western Indonesia were thus a persistent carbon sink since 15 ka but this sink was of global importance only over the past 2000 years when it likely contributed to a slower growth in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Currently, annual losses of carbon from peat drainage and fires are on average 28 times higher than the pre-disturbance rate of uptake implying that this carbon reservoir has recently switched from being a net carbon sink to a significant source of atmospheric carbon and is currently in danger of eradication.  2014 Elsevier Ltd." ;

Over much of the record temperature fluctuates from ~ 24-27 C with a mean of ~ 25 C ; however, there has been a substantial increase in temperature of ~ 2.0 C during the past ~ 100 years. The TEX86 temperature record reveals a strong similarity to the instrumental record; both records demonstrate warming (~ 0.7-1.4 C) over the past ~ 50 years as well as a cooling anomaly around 1959. Comparison of the TEX86 temperature record with the proxy records of primary productivity suggests that wind induced upwelling and/or precipitation have a strong influence on the surface temperature of Lake Malawi." ;

Spanning the last 5.0 million yrs, our environmental history of the Great Salt Lake distinguishes four intervals based on paleobiological and sedimentological characteristics, using a previously developed tephrochronology for age control. For most of its history, the Great Salt Lake Basin has been occupied by a mixture of marsh, shallow lacustrine and sand flat conditions. In contrast, open lake conditions, typical of the Bonneville cycles and the modern Great Salt Lake apparently have only dominated the basin for the past 0.6-0.8 Ma. The two main structural basins in the study area (the North and South Basins) experienced different lacustrine histories. Large but frequently saline lakes occupied the North Basin after about 0.6 Ma. In the South Basin, ephemeral, saline lacustrine conditions started at 2.1 Ma and developed to full lacustrine conditions at 0.3 Ma. Our paleoenvironmental interpretations are broadly consistent with the aquatic palynological records from the same wells, as well as with the prior core- and outcrop-based lines of evidence. However, the differences in lake history between the North and South Basin have not been previously recognized." ;

We examined the diatom fossil assemblages, sedimentation rates, organic and trace metal accumulation rates, and GIS-reconstructed human land use stressors in order to evaluate lake history and the impacts of human activities. There is evidence that the diatom community reorganized due to nutrient enrichment beginning around the time of European settlement and significant agricultural development. Trace metal profiles tracked a period of mining and ore processing which temporarily increased trace metal loads to the lake in the mid- to late-20th century. In recent decades, more oligotrophic diatom species were favored, suggesting nutrient decreases associated with remedial activities. The diatom community is now dominated by the Cyclotella comensis complex, suggesting changes in the lake's physical and chemical processes associated with climate change. Similar long-term environmental trends were observed in both core locations, but the timing of some events differed, indicating localized effects such as nutrient enrichment. An understanding of Lake Superior's past responses to human activities can inform management decisions that account for influences within and outside the lake's catchment." ;

Because lakes absorb and store heat in the spring and summer, and release heat in the autumn and winter, they also play a significant role in surface energy budgets. Lake areas fluctuate significantly over time, and thus alter surface albedo and energy partitioning in the expanding and contracting lake margin. Observations of lake areas from the 1930s \"Dust Bowl\" drought were used to approximate the impact of changes in lake area and volume on surface energy budgets. A statewide map of lake area change constructed from historical aerial photos of 620 lakes shows trends in percent area changes that mimic trends in moisture balance. Based on the aerial photos and an analysis of lake bathymetries, the water volume removed from the land exposed around the lakes during the drought was 9.1  3.0  109 m3. The total area of exposed land was 3300  800 km2. Based on a balanced energy budget estimate, the transition from standing water to exposed land at lake margins accounted for 1.12  0.31  1011 W of energy storage across the state. The decreased heat storage resulted in a statewide average storage flux anomaly of 0.50  0.14 W m-2 with localized anomalies as high as 33.9  7.1 W m-2. Large uncertainties exist, however, regarding the partitioning of the energy because of the wide range of potential albedo values for both land and water. As conditions warmed during the twentieth century, lake volumes have increased. Therefore, the assessment herein of the change in heat storage is relevant to comparisons of high regional temperatures in the 1930s and 2000s.  2009 American Meteorological Society." ;

Rates of uplift are most rapid in the eastern portion of the lowlands near the lower Albany River study area. 2 The stratigraphy of three raised bogs was investigated to determine rates and pathways of peatland development in the Albany River region. The bogs are distributed evenly along the regional chronosequence from the oldest site at Oldman (5980  100 BP) to progressively younger sites at Albany River (4810  70) and Belec Lake (3960  60). 3 Each bog had the same stratigraphic sequence, beginning with a basal tidal marsh assemblage that was rapidly replaced by a Larix-dominated swamp forest, followed by a Picea-forested bog, and ultimately a non-forested bog. The bog-fen boundary is marked by the disappearance of fen indicators, dominance of bog-forming Sphagna, and a sharp decline in nitrogen. Each of these successional stages was associated with different rates of vertical growth. 4 The rate of successional change was more rapid at the younger sites, and their vertical growth curve was more curvilinear. The formation of a raised bog, for example, was 1.3 times more rapid at Albany River and 5.5 times more rapid at Belec Lake than at Oldman. Belec Lake reached its ultimate successional stage first, although it was the last site to emerge from the sea. 5 The differential rate of isostatic uplift across this region rather than climate was the principal environmental driver for peatland development. The faster rate of uplift on the lower reaches of the drainage basin continues to reduce the regional slope, impede drainage and shift river channels, continually altering the local hydrogeological setting. 6 Groundwater flow simulations based on the Dupuit equation show that the growth of these raised bogs was probably constrained by their local hydrogeological setting. Bog formation was first induced by the creation of interfluvial divides between headwardly eroding streams or shifting river channels, and further bog growth was ultimately constrained by the width of the interfluve and the depth of river incision. The Belec Lake bog was the first to approach its limiting height because its narrow interfluve could only support a low water-table mound. 7 Although peatland succession largely followed the same conservative pathway at each site, both the pace and direction of these pathways were set by geological processes, which are probably the decisive drivers for the evolution of this large peat basin." ;

In the Great Plains region of central North America, historical droughts have persisted longer than in any other part of the United States, but no detailed records of drought patterns in this region have hitherto been obtained that extend beyond the past 500 years. Here we present a reconstruction of drought intensity and frequency over the past 2,300 years in the Northern Great Plains, based on lake salinity fluctuations inferred from fossil diatom assemblages. This record, of sub-decadal resolution, suggests that extreme droughts of greater intensity than that of the 1930s were more frequent before AD 1200. This high frequency of extreme droughts persisted for centuries, and was most pronounced during AD 200-370, AD 700-850 and AD 1000- 1200. We suggest that before AD 1200, the atmospheric circulation anomalies that produce drought today were more frequent and persistent." ;

Very few high-resolution, continental records spanning the Late Quaternary have been obtained from this region. Seismic sequence stratigraphic analysis allows a reconstruction of lake level variations. Two major hiatuses of unknown age occurred during the early evolution of the basin with the deposition of an alluvial fan in a restricted area in the intervening time period. Following the development of a relatively shallow lake during the late Pleistocene and a short desiccation pulse around 11 220 14C yr BP, a transgression of over 135 m occurred at the beginning of the Holocene. The transgression was associated with the formation of beach ridges preserved in the lake stratigraphy on the floor of the modern Lago Cardiel at four different elevations. The preservation of largely unreworked beach ridges indicates a stepwise rise in the lake level. There is no seismic evidence of a major lowering of the lake below modern level during the entire Holocene. Deposition since the mid-Holocene is marked by strong lateral differences in sediment accumulation with a depocentre slightly to the north of the basin midpoint and a pronounced mounded distribution. Seismic reflection geometries, as well as sedimentological characteristics indicate a lacustrine contourite drift covering an area of 80-100 km2 . As Lago Cardiel is under the influence of westerly winds, these most likely drove lake circulation. The identification of drowned beach ridges and of contourite drifts illustrates that high-resolution seismic stratigraphy is not only a powerful tool in reconstructing past lake level elevations for closed lake basins, but it can also provide information about the rate of lake level changes and the presence and strength of lake currents.  2004 International Association of Sedimentologists." ;

However, the rate at which prehistoric human activities led to permanent deforestation is poorly resolved. In the South Island, New Zealand, the arrival of Polynesians c. 750 years ago resulted in dramatic forest loss and conversion of nearly half of native forests to open vegetation. This transformation, termed the Initial Burning Period, is documented in pollen and charcoal records, but its speed has been poorly constrained. High-resolution chronologies developed with a series of AMS radiocarbon dates from two lake sediment cores suggest the shift from forest to shrubland occurred within decades rather than centuries at drier sites. We examine two sites representing extreme examples of the magnitude of human impacts: a drier site that was inherently more vulnerable to human-set fires and a wetter, less burnable site. The astonishing rate of deforestation at the hands of small transient populations resulted from the intrinsic vulnerability of the native flora to fire and from positive feedbacks in post-fire vegetation recovery that increased landscape flammability. Spatially targeting burning in highly-flammable seral vegetation in forests rarely experiencing fire was sufficient to create an alternate fire-prone stable state. The New Zealand example illustrates how seemingly stable forest ecosystems can experience rapid and permanent conversions. Forest loss in New Zealand is among the fastest ecological transitions documented in the Holocene; yet equally rapid transitions can be expected in present-day regions wherever positive feedbacks support alternate fire-inhibiting, fire-prone stable states." ;

Lake waters are dominated by sulfate, bicarbonate, calcium and magnesium and display a total ion concentration of ~11 meq L-1. Eleven extant ostracode species were identified. We found higher abundances of living ostracodes, as well as relatively higher species richness (eight species) and biodiversity (H of 1.6) between the littoral zone and a water depth of <20 m. At water depths >40 m, these variables all decreased. The thermocline is located at a water depth of ~20-40 m. Cluster analysis revealed three water depth ranges in the lake of importance to ostracode distribution: 1) littoral zone (0.1-3 m), 2) water depths from the base of the littoral zone to the base of the thermocline (3-40 m), and 3) water depths below the thermocline (40-160 m). The assemblage Darwinula-Heterocypris-Pseudocandona-Strandesia is characteristic of waters <15 m. The Cypridopsis-Cytheridella-Limnocythere assemblage characterizes waters <40 m and Physocypria indicates waters >40 m. Ostracode taxa from Lago Peten Itza show specific ecological preferences related to water depth and associated physico-chemical characteristics, thus illustrating the potential of ostracodes as indicators of lake level changes and hydrodynamics." ;

Currently, estimates of drought variability over the past several thousand years are based largely on tree-ring records. We produced a 1,500-y record of winter precipitation in the Pacific Northwest using a physical model-based analysis of lake sediment oxygen isotope data. Our results indicate that during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) (900-1300 AD) the Pacific Northwest experienced exceptional wetness in winter and that during the Little Ice Age (LIA) (1450-1850 AD) conditions were drier, contrasting with hydroclimatic anomalies in the desert Southwest and consistent with climate dynamics related to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). These findings are somewhat discordant with drought records from tree rings, suggesting that differences in seasonal sensitivity between the two proxies allow a more compete understanding of the climate system and likely explain disparities in inferred climate trends over centennial timescales." ;

During the past 2500 years, the pollen assemblages were dominated by Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae (Cheno/Am) and Gramineae, representing the local pollen signal of the surrounding vegetation under arid conditions. Percentage fluctuations of Cheno/Am are interpreted as reflecting lake level variations in good correspondance with oxygen isotope from the same core. A rise in lake level is recorded at about 1600 yr B.P., preceded by a relative lowstand during much of the period from 2500 to 1600 yr B.P. The top of the core is estimated to be about 600 yr old, and shows a shift of unknown duration towards a more humid condition. The high lake level documented in this paper roughly coincides with that reconstructed from other cores in the lake based on diatom and carbonate analyses.  1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, the effects of seasonal drought and the seasonal distribution of precipitation on lake-water isotopes are not well documented. To improve our understanding of lake-water isotopes, we analyzed the D and 18O values of water from a hundred lakes in the western United States across a broad range of seasonal precipitation regimes. Our results show that the isotopic composition of lake-water inputs is correlated with the isotopic composition of annual precipitation. In areas associated with the summer monsoon in northern New Mexico and southern Colorado, lake-water inputs are skewed toward summer precipitation. These results contrast with published western U.S. river-water isotopic data, which are biased toward winter precipitation, and the paradigm that lakes represent the annual moisture surplus. From the lake-water input compositions, on plots of oxygen versus hydrogen isotopes, evaporative enrichment of individual lakes follows regionally coherent evaporation trends (0.96 < r2 < 0.99). We found that the extent of evaporative enrichment in lakes is controlled by local hydrology and is not directly tied to climate or elevation. Our results suggest that paleoclimate reconstructions based on single isotope records could therefore be confounded by multiple factors (i.e., changes in air mass, seasonality of precipitation, temperature, or evaporation). A spatial network of lake-isotope records, however, could be used to separately assess the influences of these multiple factors.  2009 Geological Society of America." ;

The exploratory reconnaissance of the Gorbi Valley, on the eastern edge of Lake Fati, identified, mapped and sampled eight new sites. The results of the survey suggest a long duration occupation of the Gorbi Valley, as well as possible connections with the populations of the Inland Niger Delta and southeastern Mauritania. The Lake Fati core represents the first lake sediment core from the western Sahel. This 5.4 m sediment core contains a continuous record of lake mud from 10.43 to 4.66 kyr BP. Analysis of the core reveals that Al and Si abundances are decoupled following a deposition of 16 cm of sand at 4.5 ka BP, with Al decreasing and Si increasing rapidly. This period of sand deposition is significantly younger than that of the transition at 5.5 ka BP recorded in marine cores from ODP site 658, taken off the Mauritanian coast, potentially extending the timeframe in which dune systems were stable and lake systems were at their highstand. While highlighting the need for more localized climate chronologies and archaeological investigations, this study may shed light on circumstances surrounding the initial colonization and further development of the Lakes Region." ;

The mass loss on ignition at 550C (LOI) from lake sediment cores may vary because of temporal changes in: (1) sediment composition controlled by factors such as productivity, inorganic inputs, and decomposition; and (2) the patterns of sediment accumulation controlled by factors such as basin morphology and water level. Climatic changes can alter both. Here, modern surface samples and transects of sediment cores, collected across small (<10 ha), shallow (<4 m) lakes in the northeastern United States, show that LOI varies little (2-5%) across the deep portions of these small lakes at a given time. Large changes in LOI occur only at the transition into the littoral (shallow) zone. LOI variations in sediment cores that exceed 2-5%, therefore, appear to represent meaningful environmental changes. However, because of the many possible controls, changes in the LOI of a single core are often hard to interpret. Multiple cores increase the interpretability. At lakes studied here, similar LOI trends among several cores confirm that some LOI changes resulted from basin-wide shifts in sediment composition. Differences among cores, however, developed during the early- and mid-Holocene and indicate that the edge of the littoral zone moved towards the centers of the lakes during two periods of low lake levels, at ca. 11 000-8000 and ca. 5400-3000 cal yr B.P. The basin-wide balance of sediment sources controlled the LOI from deep-water sediments, but sedimentation patterns, which changed as lake levels changed, were also important. LOI differences among cores may therefore help identify past lake-level changes in other lakes." ;

A reconstruction of early- and mid-Holocene vegetation around Lake Kagaarholl, Northwest Iceland, examines how climate fluctuations have affected the terrestrial ecosystem. A thorough reconstruction has been made using pollen and plant macrofossil analyses combined with proxies for organic and inorganic matter. The record shows the development from a period of pioneer vegetation towards a woodland ecosystem. The deposition of the Saksunarvatn tephra at c. 10,300 cal. yr BP caused a 100-year period of instability, followed by a gradual trend of stabilization over several centuries while material left behind by retreating glaciers and tephra was being contained by expanding and developing vegetation. Early-Holocene warmth is indicated by high pollen production of Juniperus communis around the lake by c. 10,100 cal. yr BP and birch woodland being established around the lake by c. 9200 cal. yr BP, much earlier than previously believed for this locale. Cooling climate between c. 8700 and 8200 cal. yr BP halted woodland development, with reduced plant reproduction likely caused by cold spring and summer temperatures. Woodlands became re-established from c. 7900 cal. yr BP before entering a decline from c. 6000 cal. yr BP, with harsher environmental conditions apparent after c. 4200 cal. yr BP. The Kagaarholl record compares favourably with other palaeoclimatic data from the North Atlantic, demonstrating the potential of pollen and macrofossil data for reconstructions of environmental change in Iceland and as an indicator of climate variability in the North Atlantic during the Holocene." ;

ns3:98d70ff3\-898d\-317e\-bedf\-58b3a963b51a	ns2:abstracttext	"Multiproxy climate records from Iceland document complex changes in terrestrial climate and glacier fluctuations through the Holocene, revealing some coherent patterns of change as well as significant spatial variability. Most studies on the Last Glacial Maximum and subsequent deglaciation reveal a dynamic Iceland Ice Sheet (IIS) that responded abruptly to changes in ocean currents and sea level. The IIS broke up catastrophically around 15 ka as the Polar Front migrated northward and sea level rose. Indications of regional advance or halt of the glaciers are seen in late Allerod/early Younger Dryas time and again in PreBoreal time. Due to the apparent rise of relative sea level in Iceland during this time, most sites contain evidence for fluctuating, tidewater glacier termini occupying paleo fjords and bays. The time between the end of the Younger Dryas and the Preboreal was characterized by repeated jokulhlaups that eroded glacial deposits. By 10.3 ka, the main ice sheet was in rapid retreat across the highlands of Iceland. The Holocene thermal maximum (HTM) was reached after 8 ka with land temperatures estimated to be 3 C higher than the 1961-1990 reference, and net precipitation similar to modern. Such temperatures imply largely ice-free conditions across Iceland in the early to mid-Holocene. Several marine and lacustrine sediment climate proxies record substantial summer temperature depression between 8.5 and 8 ka, but no moraines have been detected from that time. Termination of the HTM and onset of Neoglacial cooling took place sometime after 6 ka with increased glacier activity between 4.5 and 4.0 ka, intensifying between 3.0 and 2.5 ka. Although a distinct warming during the Medieval Warm Period is not dramatically apparent in Icelandic records, the interval from ca AD 0 to 1200 is commonly characterized by relative stability with slow rates of change. The literature most commonly describes Little Ice Age moraines (ca AD 1250-1900) as representing the most extensive ice margins since early Holocene deglaciation, with temperature depressions of 1-2 C compared to the AD 1961-1990 average. Steep north-south and west-east temperature gradients are reconstructed in the Holocene records of Iceland, suggesting a strong maritime influence on the terrestrial climate of Iceland.  2009 Elsevier Ltd." ;

A well-preserved sequence of latero-frontal moraines in the drainage indicates that outlet glaciers advanced beyond the mountain front and coalesced on the piedmont. Glacial deposits in the Bear River drainage provide a unique setting where both 10Be cosmogenic surface-exposure dating of moraine boulders and 14C dating of sediment in Bear Lake downstream of the glaciated area set age limits on the timing of glaciation. Limiting 14C ages of glacial flour in Bear Lake (corrected to calendar years using CALIB 5.0) indicate that ice advance began at 32 ka and culminated at about 24 ka. Based on a Bayesian statistical analysis of cosmogenic surface-exposure ages from two areas on the terminal moraine complex, the Bear River glacier began its final retreat at about 18.7 to 18.1 ka, approximately coincident with the start of deglaciation elsewhere in the central Rocky Mountains and many other alpine glacial localities worldwide. Unlike valleys of the southwestern Uinta Mountains, deglaciation of the Bear River drainage began prior to the hydrologie fall of Lake Bonneville from the Provo shoreline at about 16 ka.  2007 Regents of the University of Colorado." ;

The question remains as to whether this vegetation change was driven exclusively by anthropogenic deforestation, as previously suggested, or whether it was partly attributable to climate changes. We report multiple palaeoclimate and palaeoenvironment proxies (pollen, geochemical, sedimentological) from sediment cores collected in Lake Peten Itza, northern Guatemala. Our data indicate that the earliest phase of late Holocene tropical forest reduction in this area started at  4500 cal yr BP, simultaneous with the onset of a circum-Caribbean drying trend that lasted for  1500 yr. This forest decline preceded the appearance of anthropogenically associated Zea mays pollen. We conclude that vegetation changes in Peten during the period from  4500 to  3000 cal yr BP were largely a consequence of dry climate conditions. Furthermore, palaeoclimate data from low latitudes in North Africa point to teleconnective linkages of this drying trend on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.  2008 University of Washington." ;

We present a range of observations that illustrate how the Holocene-Anthropocene transition meets these criteria in its expression in sediments from remote arctic and alpine lakes, removed from direct, catchment-scale, anthropogenic influences. In glaciated lake basins, the retreat of glaciers commonly leads to lithological successions from proglacial clastic sedimentation to non-glacial organic deposition. Sediments from the majority of lakes record marked depletions in the nitrogen stable isotopic composition of sediment organic matter, reflecting anthropogenic influences on the global nitrogen cycle. In all cases, siliceous microfossil assemblages (diatoms and chrysophytes) change markedly and directionally, with regional nuances. These stratigraphic fingerprints begin to appear in the sediment record after AD 1850, but accelerate in pulses between AD 1950 and 1970 and again after AD 1980. Our review indicates that recent environmental changes associated with humankind's dominance of key global biogeochemical cycles are sufficiently pervasive to be imprinted on the sediment record of remote lakes. Moreover, these changes are of sufficient magnitude to conclude that the Holocene has effectively ended, and that the concept of Anthropocene more aptly describes current planetary dynamics. The synthesis of these observations pertains directly to ongoing discussions concerning the eventual formalization of a new stratigraphic boundary.  2012 Elsevier B.V." ;

Results from multiple environmental indicators are internally consistent and yield a clear late Pleistocene and Holocene climate record. Carbonate content and total organic carbon (TOC) in Lake Qinghai sediments are interpreted as indicators of the strength of the Asian summer monsoon. Warm and wet intervals, associated with increased monsoon strength, are indicated by increased carbonate and TOC content. During the glacial period (~20,000 to ~14,600 cal year BP), summer monsoon intensity remained low and relatively constant at Lake Qinghai, suggesting cool, dry, and relatively stable climate conditions. The inferred stable, cold, arid environment of the glacial maximum seems to persist through the Younger Dryas time period, and little or no evidence of a warm interval correlative with the BllingAllerd is found in the QH07 record. The transition between the late Pleistocene and the Holocene, about 11,500 cal year BP, was abrupt, more so than indicated by speleothems in eastern China. The Holocene (~11,500 cal year BP to present) was a time of enhanced summer monsoon strength and greater variability, indicating relatively wetter but more unstable climatic conditions than those of the late Pleistocene. The warmest, wettest part of the Holocene, marked by increased organic matter and carbonate contents, occurred from ~11,500 to ~9,000 cal year BP, consistent with maximum summer insolation contrast between 30N and 15N. A gradual reduction in precipitation (weakened summer monsoon) is inferred from decreased carbonate content through the course of the Holocene. We propose that changes in the contrast of summer insolation between 30N and 15N are the primary control on the Asian monsoon system over glacial/interglacial time scales. Secondary influences may include regional and global albedo changes attributable to ice-cover and vegetation shifts and sea level changes (distance from moisture source in Pacific Ocean). The abruptness of the change at the beginning of the Holocene, combined with an increase in variability, suggest a threshold for the arrival of monsoonal rainfall at the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau." ;

We assessed anaerobic CH<inf>4</inf> production potentials from various depths along a 590 cm long lake sediment core that captured the entire sediment package of the talik (thaw bulb) beneath the center of an interior Alaska thermokarst lake, Vault Lake, and the top 40 cm of thawing permafrost beneath the talik. We also studied the adjacent Vault Creek permafrost tunnel that extends through ice-rich yedoma permafrost soils surrounding the lake and into underlying gravel. Our results showed CH<inf>4</inf> production potentials were highest in the organic-rich surface lake sediments, which were 151 cm thick (mean  SD: 5.95  1.67 g C-CH<inf>4</inf> g dw<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>; 125.9  36.2 g C-CH<inf>4</inf> g C<inf>org</inf><sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>). High CH<inf>4</inf> production potentials were also observed in recently thawed permafrost (1.18  0.61 g C-CH<inf>4</inf>g dw<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>; 59.60 51.5 g C-CH<inf>4</inf> g C<inf>org</inf><sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) at the bottom of the talik, but the narrow thicknesses (43 cm) of this horizon limited its overall contribution to total sediment column CH<inf>4</inf> production in the core. Lower rates of CH<inf>4</inf> production were observed in sediment horizons representing permafrost that has been thawing in the talik for a longer period of time. No CH<inf>4</inf> production was observed in samples obtained from the permafrost tunnel, a non-lake environment. Our findings imply that CH<inf>4</inf> production is highly variable in thermokarst lake systems and that both modern OM supplied to surface sediments and ancient OM supplied to both surface and deep lake sediments by in situ thaw and shore erosion of yedoma permafrost are important to lake CH<inf>4</inf> production." ;

Pine phases were coeval with the North Atlantic long stadials (cold periods) that ended Bond cycles and were terminated by Heinrich events. Lake levels were higher during pine phases, and climate was wetter. However, climate in Florida was also warmer during these phases, which were cold periods in the North Atlantic.

At Rice Lake, North Dakota, the ostracode-Mg/Ca ratios show good correlation with other ostracode, diatom and aeolian proxy records from other sites in the NGP. All of these records show significant century-scale periodicities, which have been related to solar variability as inferred from atmospheric radiocarbon records. This coherent and consistent pattern suggests that these sites record climatic variability at regional scales. The interval of the Mediaeval Climatic Anomaly from 900 to 550 cal. yr BP contains two pronounced dry periods. During the following 'Little Ice Age', a single period of frequent drought that peaked at 300 cal. yr BP was bracketed by wet periods before and after. In contrast, the ostracode-Sr/Ca ratios and ostracode- and mollusc- 18O records from Rice Lake have different patterns and do not correlate well with each other or with the same proxies at other sites. This lack of consistent pattern within a site and among several regional sites suggests seasonal and/or site-specific influences on these proxies. Variable contributions of groundwater, with low 18O values because of selective recharge from snowmelt, may have played an important role in determining the isotopic composition of the lake. The poor correlation of Sr/Ca with other proxies is caused by mediation of inorganic carbonate mineralogy, owing to active uptake of Sr in the formation of inorganic aragonite. Thus, our sediment data along with present-day lakewater chemistry suggest that carbonate-18O records in the NGP cannot be interpreted simply in terms of climate because of significant local groundwater influences. Ostracode-Mg/Ca ratios tend to be a better indicator of past salinity because of the conservative nature of Mg in oligosaline waters (<10 salinity)." ;

These data allow a first insight into the deeper structure of this unique impact crater. Wide-angle data from sonobuoys reveal a five-layer model: a water layer, two lacustrine sedimentary units that fill a bowl-shaped apparent crater morphology consisting of an upper layer of fallback breccia with P-wave velocities of similar to 3000 m/s, and a lower layer of brecciated bedrock (velocities > 3600 m/s). The lowermost layer shows a distinct anticline structure that, by analogy with other terrestrial and lunar craters of similar size, can be interpreted as a central ring structure. The El'gygytgyn crater exhibits a well-expressed morphology that is typical of craters formed in crystalline target rocks." ;

Its elemental composition as determined by X-ray fluorescence scanning exhibits significant changes since the mid-Pliocene caused by climate-driven variations in primary production, postdepositional diagenetic processes, and lake circulation as well as weathering processes in its catchment. During the mid-to late Pliocene, warmer and wetter climatic conditions are reflected by elevated Si/Ti ratios, indicating enhanced diatom production in the lake. Prior to 3.3 Ma, this signal is overprinted by intensified detrital input from the catchment, visible in maxima of clastic-related proxies, such as K. In addition, calcite formation in the early lake history points to enhanced Ca flux into the lake caused by intensified weathering in the catchment. A lack of calcite deposition after ca. 3.3 Ma is linked to the development of permafrost in the region triggered by cooling in the mid-Pliocene. After ca. 3.0 Ma the elemental data suggest a gradual transition to Pleistocene-style glacial-interglacial cyclicity. In the early Pleistocene, the cyclicity was first dominated by variations on the 41 kyr obliquity band but experienced a change to a 100 kyr eccentricity dominance during the middle Pleistocene transition (MPT) at ca. 1.2-0.6 Ma. This clearly demonstrates the sensitivity of the Lake El'gygytgyn record to orbital forcing. A successive decrease of the baseline levels of the redox-sensitive Mn/Fe ratio and magnetic susceptibility between 2.3 and 1.8 Ma reflects an overall change in the bottom-water oxygenation due to an intensified occurrence of pervasive glacial episodes in the early Pleistocene. The coincidence with major changes in the North Pacific and Bering Sea paleoceanography at ca. 1.8 Ma implies that the change in lake hydrology was caused by a regional cooling in the North Pacific and the western Beringian landmass and/or changes in the continentality. Further increases in total organic carbon and total nitrogen content after ca. 1.6 Ma are attributed to reduced organic matter decay in the sediment during prolonged anoxic periods. This points to more extensive periods of perennial ice coverage, and thus, to a progressive shifts towards more intense peak glacial periods. In the course of the Pleistocene glacial-interglacial sequence eight so-called \"super-interglacials\" occur. Their exceptionally warm conditions are reflected by extreme Si/Ti peaks accompanied by lows in Ti, K, and Fe, thus indicating extraordinary high lake productivity.  2014 Author(s)." ;

The sequence has a maximum thickness of about 115 m in two areas of the lake, but is typically less than 70 m thick over most of the basin. 14C age dates from sediment piston cores are extrapolated to provide an age estimate of about 78 000 yr BP for the oldest sediments within the Songwe Sequence. In the North and Central bathymetric basins of the lake, high resolution seismic data indicate a dynamic depositional environment, dominated by turbidity and mass flow deposits. In many areas the Songwe Sequence is underlain by a pronounced angular unconformity, suggestive of a significant, prolonged, low lake stage prior to deposition of the sequence. Major late Quaternary low lake level stages in Lake Malawi, interpreted from features identified in the seismic data and sediment core analyses, are tentatively interpreted at 6000 to 10 000 yr BP, 28 000 to >40 000 yr BP, and prior to 78 000 yr BP. Budget calculations indicate mean sediment concentrations from catchment runoff during the period of deposition of the Songwe Sequence to be about 190 mg l-1, comparable to estimates of modern rainy season discharges from the major river systems. Erosion rates within the drainage basin are estimated to be higher than the African average by a factor of three or more, probably due to the high relief within the Lake Malawi catchment. -from Authors" ;

A new 35-year resolution stable isotope record of endogenic calcite from a sediment core for Lake Grinnell in northern New Jersey provided a chance to examine the Holocene climate variations of the region in a finer detail. After the Younger Dryas cold climate reversal, the 18O fluctuated around a constant value of -7.4 until 5.8ka, thereafter shifted to a steadily decreasing trend to the most recent value of -8.2 Responding to this shift, the widely observed hemlock decline in the northeastern USA occurred about 350-500 (143.5) years later. Detrended 18O and 13C records show a clear covariance at 910-year periodicity. The amplitudes of centennial-scale 18O variations became much smaller after 4.7ka. At the same time, the dominant frequency of these variations changed from 330 to 500 years. We suggest that a non-linear response of atmospheric circulation to the gradual decrease in insolation is responsible for the shift in the climate trend at 5.8ka as indicated by the deceasing 18O values. A dominant frequency shift in solar forcing and the decreased seasonal contrast of insolation might have caused the change in climate variability at 4.7ka through modulating ocean and atmosphere circulations.  2010 Elsevier Ltd." ;

Five major themes emerge from this research. First the pilot cores and seismic data show that El'gygytygn Crater Lake contains what is expected to be the longest, most continuous terrestrial record of past climate change in the entire Arctic back to the time of impact. Second, processes operating in the El'gygytygn basin lead to changes in the limnogeology and the biogeochemistry that reflect robust changes in the regional climate and paleoecology over a large part of the western Arctic. Third, the magnetic susceptibility and other proxies record numerous rapid change events. The recovered lake sediment contains both the best-resolved record of the last interglacial and the longest terrestrial record of millennial scale climate change in the Arctic, yielding a high fidelity multi-proxy record extending nearly 150,000 years beyond what has been obtained from the Greenland Ice Sheet. Fourth, the potential for evaluating teleconnections under different mean climate states is high. Despite the heterogeneous nature of recent Arctic climate change, millennial scale climate events in the North Atlantic/Greenland region are recorded in the most distal regions of the Arctic under variable boundary conditions. Finally, deep drilling of the complete depositional record in Lake El'gygytgyn will offer new insights and, perhaps, surprises into the late Cenozoic evolution of Arctic climate." ;

We present a well-dated 170,000-year time series of hydrologic variation from the southern hemisphere tropics of South America that extends from modern times through most of the penultimate glacial period. Alternating mud and salt units in a core from Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia reflect alternations between wet and dry periods. The most striking feature of the sequence is that the duration of paleolakes increased in the late Quaternary. This change may reflect increased precipitation, geomorphic or tectonic processes that affected basin hydrology, or some combination of both. The dominance of salt between 170,000 and 140,000 yr ago indicates that much of the penultimate glacial period was dry, in contrast to wet conditions in the LGM. Our analyses also suggest that the relative influence of insolation forcing on regional moisture budgets may have been stronger during the past 50,000 years than in earlier times.  2003 University of Washington.

A robust age model based on 15 AMS radiocarbon dates underpins the first precise reconstruction of rapid climate changes during the Holocene from this area. During the Early Holocene, increased winter snowpack and high snowmelt during summer, as a consequence of high seasonality, led to higher lake levels, a chironomid community dominated by non-lacustrine taxa (Orthocladiinae) related to higher inlet streams, and a forested landscape with intense run-off processes in the watershed. From 9.8 to 8.1 cal ka BP, climate instability is inferred from rapid and intense forest shifts and high fluctuation in surface run-off. Shifts among conifers and mesophytes reveal at least four short-lived dry events at 9.7, 9.3, 8.8 and 8.3 cal ka BP. Between 8.1 and 5.7 cal ka BP a stable climate with higher precipitation favoured highest lake levels and forest expansion, with spread of mesophytes, withdrawal of conifers and intensification of fires, coinciding with the Holocene Climate Optimum. At 5.7 cal ka BP a major change leading to drier conditions contributed to a regional decline in mesophytes, expansion of pines and junipers, and a significant lake level drop. Despite drier conditions, fire activity dropped as consequence of biomass reduction. Two arid intervals occurred between 2.9 and 2.4 cal ka BP and at 1.20.7 cal ka BP (8001300 AD). The latter coincides with the Medieval Climate Anomaly and is one of the most arid phases of the Holocene in BSM sequence. Anthropogenic disturbances were small until 700 AD, when human pressure over landscape intensified, with Olea cultivation in the lowlands and significant deforestation in highlands. Colder and unfavourable weather conditions during the second part of the Little Ice Age caused a temporary cease of high-land management. The most intense anthropogenic disturbances occurred during the second half of 19th century. Last decades are characterized by recovery of the vegetation cover as a result of land abandonment, and lowered lake levels, probably due to higher temperatures." ;

Here we use high-resolution charcoal particle accumulation, inorganic carbon precipitation and magnetic susceptibility data from Lake Chalco, located in high-altitude tropical central Mexico, to assess the fire regimes and drought periods between 85 and 10.8k cal a BP. Overall, drought intervals were characterized by high carbonate deposition and were contemporary with high spring insolation. Most of the high fire activity periods were coupled with droughts, whereas some of them seem to have responded to volcanic activity in the basin. Periods of more fire activity during the latest part of Marine Isotope Stage 3 were associated with a long interval of higher spring insolation. Increase in drought frequency during 47-27k cal a BP were possibly linked to a more active Laurentide Ice Sheet influencing the oceanic and atmospheric controls of the tropical climatic system. In fact, Chalco and Cariaco records show similar millennial-scale trends, suggesting a role of the Intertropical Convergence Zone in modulating moisture availability in the region." ;

Recent studies of local vegetation from lowland sites have reported contrasting rainfall signals during the Younger Dryas (YD). The Lake Malawi record tracks regional vegetation changes and allows comparison with other tropical African records identifying vegetation opening and local forest maintenance during the YD. Our record shows a gradual decline of afromontane vegetation at 18 ka. Around 14.5 ka, tropical seasonal forest and Zambezian miombo woodland became established. At ~ 13 ka, drier, more open formations gradually became prevalent. Although tropical seasonal forest taxa were still present in the watershed during the YD, this drought-intolerant forest type was likely restricted to areas of favorable edaphic conditions along permanent waterways. The establishment of drought-tolerant vegetation followed the reinforcement of southeasterly tradewinds resulting in a more pronounced dry winter season after ~ 11.8 ka. The onset of the driest, most open vegetation type was coincident with a lake low stand at the beginning of the Holocene. This study demonstrates the importance of global climate forcing and local geomorphological conditions in controlling vegetation distribution." ;

This record is derived from core and outcrop sites extending from a proximal deltaic setting to near the modern depocenter. Lithostratigraphic, paleontologic (ostracodes and pollen) and geochemical indicators all provide evidence for hydroclimate and climate change over the study interval.Lithostratigraphic analysis of the Summer Lake deposits allows subdivision into a series of unconformity - or paraconformity-bound lithosomes. The unconformity and facies histories indicate that the lake underwent several major lake-level excursions through the Middle and Late Pleistocene. High stands occurred between ~200 and ~165 ka, between ~89 and 50 ka and between ~25 and 13 ka. Uppermost Pleistocene and Holocene sediments have been removed by deflation of the basin, with the exception of a thin veneer of late Holocene sediment. These high stands correspond closely with Marine Oxygen Isotope Stages 6, 4 and 2, within the margin of error associated with the Summer Lake age model. A major unconformity from ~158 ka until ~102 ka (duration varies between sites) interrupts the record at both core and outcrop sites.Lake level fluctuations, in turn are closely linked with TOC and salinity fluctuations, such that periods of lake high stands correlate with periods of relatively low productivity, fresher water and increased water inflow/evaporation ratios. Paleotemperature estimates based on palynology and geochemistry (Mg/Ca ratios in ostracodes) indicate an overall decrease in temperature from ~236 ka-165 ka, with a brief interlude of warming and drying immediately after this (prior to the major unconformity). This temperature decrease was superimposed on higher frequency variations in temperature that are not evident in the sediments deposited during the past 100 ka. Indicators disagree about temperatures immediately following the unconformity (~102-95 ka), but most suggest warmer temperatures between ~100-89 ka, followed by a rapid and dramatic cooling event. Cooler conditions persisted throughout most of the remainder of the Pleistocene at Summer Lake, with the possible exception of brief warm intervals about 27-23 ka. Paleotemperature estimates for the proximal deltaic site are more erratic than for more distal sites, indicative of short term air temperature excursions that are buffered in deeper water.Estimates of paleotemperature from Mg/Ca ratios are generally in good agreement with evidence from upland palynology. However, there is a significant discordance between the upland pollen record and lake indicators with respect to paleoprecipitation for some parts of the record. Several possibilities may explain this discordance. We favor a direct link between lake level and salinity fluctuations and climate change, but we also recognize the possibility that some of these hydroclimate changes in the Summer Lake record may have resulted from episodic drainage captures of the Chewaucan River between the Summer Lake and Lake Abert basins." ;

There are, however, few quantitative records showing the history of this contamination in large rivers. Here we present a well-dated sedimentary record of trace metal accumulation in Lake St. Croix, a natural riverine lake on the St. Croix River (Minnesota and Wisconsin, USA), revealing the history of heavy metal inputs to the river over the past 200 years. Concentrations of Hg, Pb, Ag, Cd, Cr and Zn and stable Pb isotopes were measured in eight 210Pb-dated sediment cores collected from profundal depositional areas throughout the lake. Time trends of trace metal concentrations and accumulation rates differed greatly between the upper lake (above Valley Creek) and the lower lake, reflecting contrasting sediment sources along the flow axis of the lake. For most of the study period (18002000 AD), sediment deposited throughout the lake derived almost exclusively from the suspended sediment load carried by the main-stem river into the lake. From 1910 through 1970, however, large inputs of eroded soils and stream channel sediments from side-valley tributaries resulted in greatly increased sediment and trace metal accumulation in the lower lake. Anthropogenic accumulation rates of Hg, Pb, Cd, Zn, and Ag in the upper lake correlate well with those from Square Lake, a small, relatively undisturbed nearby lake that has received trace metal inputs almost exclusively via atmospheric deposition. The similarity of these records suggests that atmospheric deposition was primarily responsible for trace metal accumulation trends in upper Lake St. Croix. Trace metal accumulation in the lower lake was also strongly influenced by atmospherically derived inputs, but metal contributions from native soils were important, as well, during the period of elevated sediment inputs from side-valley tributaries. Concentrations and accumulation rates of trace metals in both upper and lower lake sediments have decreased substantially since the 1970s due to decreased atmospheric inputs and sediment loadings, but accumulation rates remain well above pre-settlement values. Metal inputs to Lake St. Croix have been far lower than those to nearby Lake Pepin, located on the Mississippi River downstream of the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, but there nevertheless remains a clear record of anthropogenic impact on the relatively pristine St. Croix River." ;

In this study, we developed calibration models based on FTIRS for the quantitative determination of biogenic silica (BSi; n Combining double low line 420; gradient: 0.9-56.5%), total organic carbon (TOC; n Combining double low line 309; gradient: 0-2.9%), and total inorganic carbon (TIC; nCombining double low line 152; gradient: 0-0.4%) in a 318 m-long sediment record with a basal age of 3.6 million years from Lake El'gygytgyn, Far East Russian Arctic. The developed partial least squares (PLS) regression models yield high cross-validated (CV) R2CV Combining double low line 0.86-0.91 and low root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV) (3.1-7.0% of the gradient for the different properties). By applying these models to 6771 samples from the entire sediment record, we obtained detailed insight into bioproductivity variations in Lake El'gygytgyn throughout the middle to late Pliocene and Quaternary. High accumulation rates of BSi indicate a productivity maximum during the middle Pliocene (3.6-3.3 Ma), followed by gradually decreasing rates during the late Pliocene and Quaternary. The average BSi accumulation during the middle Pliocene was 3 times higher than maximum accumulation rates during the past 1.5 million years. The indicated progressive deterioration of environmental and climatic conditions in the Siberian Arctic starting at ca. 3.3 Ma is consistent with the first occurrence of glacial periods and the finally complete establishment of glacial-interglacial cycles during the Quaternary.

Pollen analysis shows a rapid transition from oak (Quercus spp.)-dominated woodland to a relatively open pine (Pinus spp.) forest at 1450 cal. yr BP, and a more closed-canopy pine forest beginning about 700 cal. yr BP. We calculated accumulation rates of 125-250 um charcoal fragments (CHAR) in contiguous 0.5 cm thick sediment samples, each representing 7-10 years. Graminoid charcoal fragments were tallied separately to track the relative abundance of grass charcoal. During the oak period charcoal peaks have relatively weak periodicity and relatively high accumulation rates of grass charcoal. Charcoal peaks are less frequent (with a periodicity of 130-200 years), and larger during the open-canopy pine period, with lower grass CHAR. CHAR of both charcoal types decreases further between 1000 and 850 cal. yr BP and remains low until the period of European settlement. Several hundred years later (700 cal. yr BP) white pine pollen increases and pollen from herbaceous taxa decreases, suggesting a more mesic, closed-canopy forest. Our results demonstrate that the vegetation and fire regime at this sandplain site changed substantially, but apparently not synchronously, during the last 2300 years, a period when millennial-scale regional climate was relatively similar to modern." ;

Here we report a late Holocene reconstruction from Zaca Lake in coastal southern California, together with modern hydrological and vegetation studies in the catchment. The small catchment and decadal sampling resolution throughout the 9m, 3000yr sedimentary record provided a high resolution terrigenous counterpart of nearby marine records from the Santa Barbara Basin. Today, D values of precipitation average -51.518 (1, n=7). Modern plant leaf wax D values for the C28 n-alkanoic acid averaged -14111 (1, n=10) for Quercus agrifolia, with a calculated fractionation relative to precipitation (wax/precip) of -9422 (1, n=10); in contrast, there was negligible production of the C28 acid by co-dominant Pinus coulteri. Downcore, the C28 acid D values ranged between -101 and -177 (mean -1508, 1, n=490). Abundance distributions suggested that the sedimentary C28 acid was dominated by Quercus, implying that paleoprecipitation varied between extremes of -8 and -92 (mean -6314, compound 1, n=490). The 3000yr leaf wax D/H record from Zaca Lake revealed substantial temporal variability, greater than observed in a speleothem reconstruction of similar resolution. We suggest that the plant-based proxy may magnify the variability by sampling spring precipitation preferentially. Centennial-duration positive isotopic excursions were associated with more sub-tropical moisture sources and drier conditions including during the Medieval Climatic Anomaly, and negative excursions were associated with N Pacific sources and wetter conditions including during the Little Ice Age.  2013 Elsevier Ltd." ;

A sodium pyrophosphate extraction provides information about leaching of exchangeable and organically complexed cations from terrestrial sources, while an acidified ammonium oxalate extraction removes mineral materials without well-developed crystalline structure that are indicative of podzolization. More evidence of pedogenesis is preserved in sediment of the lake on outwash- likely a result of greater retention of material within the soil profile in the catchment on till. This difference between the record suggests that excessively well-drained (leaky) catchments may provide better records of soil development than those with higher water-holding capacity. Evidence of acidification and podzolization appeared first at the lake on till and 4500 years later at the lake on outwash. Both records reveal a late Holocene intensification of weathering that coincided with a regional climatic change to greater moisture availability. The variability in weathering rates observed presents a more complex picture of weathering than the simple exponential functions often assumed in chronosequence studies. Use of lake sediment records provides better temporal resolution of significant events in soil formation than could be achieved using a chronosequence approach.  2002 University of Washington." ;

Most lake drilling efforts to date have focused on paleoclimate reconstruction. However, it is clear from the excellent fossil preservation and high temporal resolution typical of lake beds that significant advances in evolutionary biology can be made through drill core studies coordinated with phylogenetic work on appropriate taxa. Geological records can be used to constrain the age of specific lakes and the timing of evolutionarily significant events (such as lake level fluctuations and salinity crises). Fossil data can be used to test speciation and biogeographic hypotheses and flesh out phylogenetic trees, using a better-resolved fossil record to estimate timing of phylogenetic divergences. The extraordinary preservation of many fossils in anoxic lake beds holds the hope of collecting fossil DNA from the same body fossils that improve our understanding of morphological character evolution and adaptation. Moreover, fossils allow calibration of molecular clocks, which are currently largely inferential. Lake Malawi Drilling Project results provide some guideposts on what might be expected in a drilling project for studies of evolution. The extreme variability in lake level and environmental history that most ancient lakes experience (exemplified by the Lake Malawi record) demonstrates that no one drilling locality is likely to provide a complete record of phylogenetic history for a radiating lineage. Evolutionary biologists should take an active role in the design of drilling projects, which typically have interdisciplinary objectives, to ensure their sampling needs will be met by whatever sites in a lake are ultimately drilled.  2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

Our study region corresponds to the confluence of three air streams that control central North American climates and, hence, should be sensitive to climate change. Sediment cores were analyzed for evidence of Holocene vegetation and fire from tall-grass prairie in eastern North Dakota (Moon Lake), from mixed forest near the prairie border in northwestern Minnesota (Deming Lake), and from mixed forest more remote from prairie in western Wisconsin (Dark Lake). Together with pollen and charcoal analysis, we present a new method for determining 13C of terrestrial (charred) organic matter and, thus, the relative importance of C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways in past vegetation. Paleorecords were supplemented with surface charcoal accumulation and 13C from 21 North American lakes that span boreal, deciduous, pine, and mixed forest to tall- and mixed-grass prairie. Surface charcoal and 13C follow vegetation and climate gradients, with high charcoal accumulation and 13C (-20) in the Plains (Dakotas, Nebraska, and southwest Minnesota) and decreases to the east, west, and north. The 13C pattern is consistent with observed patterns of C3:C4 dominance across the region. Sediment, pollen, charcoal, and terrestrial 13C show that vegetation response to climate change varied substantially among tall-grass prairie, bordering woodland, and forest. During maximum aridity (8000-4000 yr BP) prairie vegetation in eastern North Dakota showed a demise of woody vegetation followed by a fluctuating dominance of grasses (40% C4) and forbs. Meanwhile, prairie expanded eastward into northwestern Minnesota, where it produced a shifting dominance between mostly C4 grasses and woody vegetation until more humid conditions and mixed forest developed after 4000 yr BP. Mixed forest in southwestern Wisconsin showed little response to mid-Holocene aridity. Elevated 13C values from 5000 to 3000 yr BP suggest that composition of grasses changed (to increased C4), although pollen data indicate that the total abundance of grasses remained constant. The increase in C4 grasses at this time is consistent with previous studies suggesting a delayed dry interval in eastern Iowa. Reduced aridity of the last 2000 yr brought increased fire to tall-grass prairie as higher primary productivity led to increased fuel load. Meanwhile, forest expanded in northwestern Minnesota, leading to decreased ignition and fine fuels, in turn resulting in decreased fire at the woodland margin." ;

We revisited sediment core sites in Lake Pepin (Minnesota, Wisconsin) more than a decade after an original set of 10 cores was collected, dated radiometrically, and studied in 1996. Prominent magnetic susceptibility features were used to align the new core set with the older set, such that traditional radiometric dating was not necessary to obtain a chronology for the new cores. The procedure used to align the two core sets accounted for compaction of former surface sediments by burial with new sediment. The amount of new sediment, mercury, and phosphorus accumulated at each core site was determined and extrapolated to the depositional area of the lake to estimate recent (1996-2008) whole-basin loads. Recent sediment accumulation in Lake Pepin compared well (within 3%) with monitored inflow data from a gauging station on the upper Mississippi River just before it enters the lake. Bulk sediment accumulation rate remained very high (772,000 t/year) for the recent period (1996-2008), down slightly from the peak in 1990-1996 (876,000 t/year), and almost an order of magnitude above pre-settlement rates. Total phosphorus deposition remained constant since a peak in the 1960s, but was also well above pre-settlement rates. Mercury continued its precipitous decline since peaking in the 1960s.  2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht." ;

Correlation of these records from Lake Edward to other climatically-forced geochemical and lake level records from Lakes Naivasha, Tanganyika, and Turkana allows us to develop a chronology of drought events in equatorial East Africa during the late Holocene. Major drought events of at least century-scale duration are recorded in lacustrine records at about 850, 1500, 2000, and 4100 cal year BP. Of these, the most severe event occurred between about 2050 and 1850 cal year BP, during which time Lake Edward stood about 15 m below its present level. Numerous additional droughts of less intensity and/or duration are present in the Lake Edward record, some of which may be correlated to other lacustrine climate records from equatorial East Africa. These events are superimposed on a long-term trend of increasingly arid conditions from 5400 to about 2000 cal year BP, followed by a shift toward wetter climates that may have resulted from an intensification of the winter Indian monsoon. Although the causes of decade- to century-scale climate variability in the East African tropics remain obscure, time-series spectral analysis suggests no direct linkage between solar output and regional rainfall. Rather, significant periods of 725, 125, 63-72, 31-25, and 19-16 years suggest a tight linkage between the Indian Ocean and African rainfall, and could result from coupled ocean-atmosphere variability inherent to the tropical monsoon system.  2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we refine the methodology for utilizing lakes and bogs downwind of dune fields as precise recorders of past eolian activity. Sediment cores from two Allegan County lakes and one bog associated with dunes were studied to evaluate the importance of the various sand transport pathways into lakes and bogs. Goshorn Lake's western edge directly abuts a large parabolic dune. Sand concentrations decrease in cores away from the dunes, possibly reflecting avalanching into the lake followed by sediment gravity flows along the lake bottom. Sand input from stream flow was minor. The Allegan Bog core records a fenemergent bog transition coincident with a decrease in the sand influx. Poorly understood shoreline processes may have contributed sand to the basin's center before the bog's emergence. Sand in Gilligan Lake cores is texturally similar to adjacent dune sand and the eolian activity history derived from this sand is nearly identical to the history derived from the dune's paleosols and optically stimulated luminescence ages. A proposed lake and bog sampling strategy includes choosing sites in the lee of large dunes edged with emergent vegetation and away from steep slopes or stream inlets. The lake's bathymetry should also be considered. Distinguishing between grain fall sedimentary structures and mass movement or sediment gravity flows is important. This strategy provides relatively high resolution, continuous eolian activity histories that can be correlated with paleoenvironmental proxies from the same cores." ;

In 2009, the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) at Lake El'gygytgyn obtained a continuous sediment sequence of the lacustrine deposits and the upper part of the impact breccia. Here, we present grain-size data of the past 2.6 Ma. General downcore grain-size variations yield coarser sediments during warm periods and finer ones during cold periods. According to principal component analysis (PCA), the climate-dependent variations in grain-size distributions mainly occur in the coarse silt and very fine silt fraction. During interglacial periods, accumulation of coarser material in the lake center is caused by redistribution of clastic material by a wind-induced current pattern during the ice-free period. Sediment supply to the lake is triggered by the thickness of the active layer in the catchment and the availability of water as a transport medium. During glacial periods, sedimentation at Lake El'gygytgyn is hampered by the occurrence of a perennial ice cover, with sedimentation being restricted to seasonal moats and vertical conduits through the ice. Thus, the summer temperature predominantly triggers transport of coarse material into the lake center. Time series analysis that was carried out to gain insight into the frequency of the grain-size data showed variations predominately on 98.5, 40.6, and 22.9 kyr oscillations, which correspond to Milankovitch's eccentricity, obliquity and precession bands. Variations in the relative power of these three oscillation bands during the Quaternary suggest that sedimentation processes at Lake El'gygytgyn are dominated by environmental variations caused by global glacial-interglacial variations (eccentricity, obliquity), and local insolation forcing and/or latitudinal teleconnections (precession), respectively.

We present sediment oxygen isotope records spanning the last two millennia from 10 lakes, as well as climate model simulations, indicating that the Little Ice Age was dry relative to the Medieval Climate Anomaly in much of the Pacific Northwest of North America. This pattern is consistent with observed associations between the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Northern Annular Mode, and drought as well as with proxy-based reconstructions of Pacific and Atlantic ocean-atmosphere variations over the past 1000-years the large amplitude of centennial variability indicated by the lake data suggests that regional hydroclimate is characterized by longer-term shifts in ENSO-like dynamics and that an improved understanding of the centennial timescale relationship between external forcing and drought is necessary for projecting future hydroclimatic conditions in western North America.

Sediment cores were collected from 29 new lake and bog sites in Ohio and Indiana to address this gap. The basal radiocarbon dates from these cores show that initial ice retreat from the maximal last-glacial ice extent occurred by 22 ka, and numerous sites that are ~ 100 km inside this limit were exposed by 18.9 ka. Post-glacial environmental changes were identified as stratigraphic or biologic changes in select cores. The strongest signal occurs between 18.5 and 14.6 ka. These Midwestern events correspond with evidence to the northeast, suggesting that initial deglaciation of the ice sheet, and ensuing environmental changes, were episodic and rapid. Significantly, these changes predate the onset of the Blling postglacial warming (14.8 ka) as recorded by the Greenland ice cores. Thus, deglaciation and landscape change around the southern margins of the Laurentide Ice Sheet happened ~ 7 ka before postglacial changes were felt in central Greenland." ;

Multi-year droughts during the instrumental period and decadal-length droughts of the past two millennia were shorter and climatically different from the future permanent, 'dust-bowl-like' megadrought conditions, lasting decades to a century, that are predicted as a consequence of warming. So far, it has been unclear whether or not such megadroughts occurred in the southwestern US, and, if so, with what regularity and intensity. Here we show that periods of aridity lasting centuries to millennia occurred in the southwestern US during mid-Pleistocene interglacials. Using molecular palaeotemperature proxies to reconstruct the mean annual temperature (MAT) in mid-Pleistocene lacustrine sediment from the Valles Caldera, New Mexico, we found that the driest conditions occurred during the warmest phases of interglacials, when the MAT was comparable to or higher than the modern MAT. A collapse of drought-tolerant C(4) plant communities during these warm, dry intervals indicates a significant reduction in summer precipitation, possibly in response to a poleward migration of the subtropical dry zone. Three MAT cycles 2 C in amplitude occurred within Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 and seem to correspond to the muted precessional cycles within this interglacial. In comparison with MIS 11, MIS 13 experienced higher precessional-cycle amplitudes, larger variations in MAT (4-6 C) and a longer period of extended warmth, suggesting that local insolation variations were important to interglacial climatic variability in the southwestern US. Comparison of the early MIS 11 climate record with the Holocene record shows many similarities and implies that, in the absence of anthropogenic forcing, the region should be entering a cooler and wetter phase." ;

ns3:a4dfd141\-fbc2\-3b4e\-8030\-65207ef93187	ns2:abstracttext	"For more than a century it has been postulated that the Holocene vegetation of western Europe has changed in significant ways. A half-century ago a lively debate revolved on whether there were one or two dry intervals causing bogs to dry out and become forested, or whether instead the climate warmed to a maximum and then cooled. Today none of these climatic schemes is accepted without reservation, because two nonclimatic factors are recognized as significant: the differential immigration rates of dominant tree types (e.g., spruce in the north and beech in the south) brought unexpected changes in forest composition, and Neolithic man cleared the forest for agriculture and thereby disrupted the natural plant associations. In North America some of the same problems exist. In the hardwood forests of the Northeast, which are richer than but otherwise not unlike those of western Europe, the successive spread of white pine, hemlock, beech, hickory, and chestnut into oakdominated forests provides a pollen sequence that may yield no climatic message. On the other hand, on the ecotone between these hardwood forests and the conifer forests of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence area, the southward expansion of spruce, fir, and tamarack in the late Holocene implies a climatic cooling of regional importance, although the progressive conversion of lakes to wetlands favored the expansion of wetland forms of these genera. In the southeastern states the late-Holocene expansion of southern pines has uncertain climatic significance. About all that can be said about the distribution and ecology of the 10 or so species is that some of them favor sandy soils and are adapted to frequent fires. In coastal areas the expansion of pines was accompanied by development of great swamps like Okefenokee and the Everglades-perhaps related to the stabilization of the water table after the early Holocene rise of sea level. The vegetation replaced by the pines in Florida consisted of oak scrub with prairie-like openings, indicating dry early Holocene conditions, which in fact had also prevailed during the time of Wisconsin glaciation. In the Midwest the vegetation history provides a clearer record of Holocene climatic change, at least along the prairie border in Minnesota. With the withdrawal of the boreal spruce forest soon after ice retreat, pine forest and hardwood forest succeeded rapidly, as in the eastern states. But prairie was not far behind. By 7000 years ago the prairie had advanced into east-central Minnesota, 75 miles east of its present limit. It then withdrew to the west, as hardwoods expanded again, followed by conifers from the north. The sequence easily fits the paleoclimatic concept of gradual warming and drying to a maximum, followed by cooling to the present day. It is supported by independent fossil evidence from lake sediments, showing that lakes were shallow or even intermittently dry during mid-Holocene time. Here we have a paleoclimatic pattern that is consistent with the record from glaciers in the western mountains-a record that involves a late-Holocene Neoglaciation after a mid-Holocene interval of distant glacial recession. Just as the Neoglaciation is time-transgressive, according to the review of its evidence by Porter and Denton, so also is the mid-Holocene episode of maximum warmth, and they are thus both geologicclimate units. The warm episode is commonly termed the Hypsithermal, which, however, was defined by Deevey and Flint as a time-stratigraphic unit that is supposed to have time-parallel rather than time-transgressive boundaries. It was defined on the basis of pollen-zone boundaries in western Europe and the northeastern United States that have a sound biogeographic but questionable paleoclimatic basis. Perhaps it should be redefined as Porter and Denton suggest, as a geologic-climate unit with recognizable time-transgressive boundaries that match the gradual geographic shifts in the general circulation of the atmosphere and the resulting location of storm tracks and weather patterns. Holocene glacial and vegetational progressions provide a good record of climatic change, if one can work out the lag effects related to the glacial economy and the geographic factors controlling tree migration. The terminology for the Holocene, where so much time control is available, should indicate the dynamic character not only of the climate but also of the geologic and biogeographic processes controlled by climate.  1976." ;

A good correspondence between diatom-inferred salinity and historical records of mean annual precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P - ET) strongly suggests that the sedimentary record from Moon Lake can be used to reconstruct past climatic conditions. Century-scale analysis of the Holocene diatom record indicates four major hydrological periods: an early Holocene transition from an open freshwater system to a closed saline system by 7300 B.P., which corresponds with a transition from spruce forest to deciduous parkland to prairie and indicates a major shift from wet to dry climate; a mid-Holocene period of high salinity from 7300 to 4700 B.P., indicating low effective moisture (P - ET); a transitional period of high salinity from 4700 to 2200 B.P., characterized by poor diatom preservation; and a late Holocene period of variable lower salinity during the past 2,200 yr, indicating fluctuations in effective moisture." ;

Total organic carbon and authigenic carbonate in two independently analyzed and dated cores indicate (1) relative stability and aridity during the glacial interval, (2) small variations during the Blling-Allerd and the Younger Dryas intervals, (3) comparatively abrupt change at the late Pleistocene/Holocene transition, and (4) relatively high variability during a wet early Holocene. Taken together, the data suggest that a climate threshold exists for penetration of Asian monsoon rainfall onto the Tibetan Plateau, a threshold that was crossed at the beginning of the Holocene. Conceptually, the threshold simply may be related to the topographic barrier that the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau presents to the landward penetration of the monsoon, or it may be related to nonlinearities in the climate system itself, such as sudden shifts in the configuration of the Westerly jet stream. Different mechanisms for producing a threshold are not mutually exclusive and may have combined to affect the dynamics of the Asian monsoon. In any case, the threshold is related to the presence of the Tibetan Plateau, which has a profound influence on the Asia monsoon system.

Here we present a fossil pollen record from sediment cores extracted from Lake Bosumtwi (West Africa). This record covers the last c. 520 thousand years (ka) and represents the longest terrestrial pollen record from Africa published to date. The fossil pollen assemblages reveal dynamic vegetation change which can be broadly characterized as indicative of shifts between savannah and forest. Savannah formations are heavily dominated by grass (Poaceae) pollen (>55%) typically associated with Cyperaceae, ChenopodiaceaeAmaranthaceae and Caryophyllaceae. Forest formations are palynologically more diverse than the savannah, with the key taxa occurring in multiple forest zones being Moraceae, Celtis, Uapaca, Macaranga and Trema. The fossil pollen data indicate that over the last c. 520 ka the vegetation of lowland tropical West Africa has mainly been savannah; however six periods of forest expansion are evident which most likely correspond to global interglacial periods. A comparison of the forest assemblage composition within each interglacial suggests that the Holocene (110 ka) forest occurred under the wettest climate, while the forest which occurred at the time of Marine Isotope Stage 7 probably occurred under the driest climate." ;

BBCP cores are being used to develop high-resolution proxy records of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) and Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (ETM2) hyperthermal events. These events are short-term, large magnitude global warming events associated with extreme perturbations to the earth's carbon cycle. Although the PETM and ETM2 occurred ~ 55-52 million years ago, they are analogous in many ways to modern anthropogenic changes to the carbon cycle. By applying various sedimentological, geochemical, and palynological methods to the cores, we hope to better understand what caused these events, study the biogeochemical and ecological feedbacks that operated during them, and reveal precisely how they impacted continental environments. Core recovery was > 98% in all holes and most drilling was carried out without fluid additives, showing that continuous coring of continental smectitic deposits like these can be achieved with minimal risk of contamination to molecular biomarkers. Cores were processed in the Bremen Core Repository where the science team convened for 17 days to carry out data collection and sampling protocols similar to IODP projects. Initial results show that the weathered horizon extends to as much as ~ 30m below the surface and variations in magnetic susceptibility within the cores record an interplay between grain size and pedogenesis. Previous investigations of outcrops near the BBCP drill sites allow detailed evaluation of the effects of weathering on common proxy methods. Studies of lithofacies, organic geochemistry, stable isotope geochemistry, calibrated XRF core scanning, paleomagnetics, and palynology are underway and will represent the highest resolution and most integrated proxy records of the PETM from a continental setting yet known. An extensive outreach program is in place to capitalize on the educational value associated with the Bighorn Basin's unusually complete record of Phanerozoic earth history.  Author(s) 2013." ;

Despite their scarcity, carbonates along with organic matter provide significant paleoenvironmental information about lake systems. This study focuses on the carbonates in Lake Chungara, their morphologies, distribution and origin deduced from the isotopic markers. These markers reflected changes in the water and the biomass between the onset of the Holocene and around 9.6cal kyr BP. These changes are marked by general increases in TOC, TN, and TN-15NAIR, and by fluctuating values of TOC-13CVPDB in its sediments and are probably related to major shifts in the lake surface/volume associated with rises in lake level. An increase in salinity around 10cal kyr BP is thought to be linked to a short dry period, giving rise to the onset of carbonate production. The mid-Holocene arid period between 7.3 and 3.5calka BP, with a maximum of aridity around 6.0cal kyr BP, was deduced from 18OVPDB values in the endogenic carbonates. These results match the reconstructions in Lake Titicaca based on benthic diatoms and paleoshore levels.Offshore sediments mainly consist of a diatomaceous ooze, laminated in the lower half (Unit 1), and banded-massive with tephra layers in the upper half of the sequence (Unit 2). TOC-13CVPDB and the C/N ratio confirm that phytoplankton was the main source of organic matter in these sediments. Shallower sediments (units 3 to 5) developed in platform and littoral settings, providing evidence of subaqueous macrophytes and, to a lesser extent, land plants. Carbonate content ranges between 0.1 and 6wt.% in offshore settings (30 to 40m water depth) and reaches the maximum values in the lower part of Unit 2. Carbonate minerals (low magnesium calcite and minor amounts of high magnesium calcite and aragonite) are scarce and are arranged in mm-thick layers, commonly forming cm-thick levels or bioclasts. Carbonate layers are made up of euhedral-to-subhedral spindle-shaped calcite crystals and, to a lesser extent, aragonite needles, all in the m range. Aragonite spheroids coexist in littoral sediments with other carbonate shapes and charophyte remains, where carbonate reaches locally up to 20wt.%. CO2 photosynthetic depletions related to seasonal phytoplankton blooms were responsible for the high frequency deposition of mm-thick carbonate layers.The average values for 13CVPDB in lake water, plankton and sediments of Lake Chungara (as organic matter or as carbonate) are around 15 higher than commonly reported values in other lakes. This 13C enrichment is attributed to carbon assimilation from a DIC affected by methanogenesis, in which HCO3 - is the dominant species. The 13CVPDB and 18OVPDB variations and their covariation in endogenic carbonates suggest that lake water volume and lake level increased along the Holocene.  2011 Elsevier B.V." ;

The flagship of this ecocidal paradigm is the supposed abrupt, island-wide deforestation that occurred about one millennium ago, a few centuries after the arrival of Polynesian settlers to the island. Other hypotheses attribute the forest demise to different causes such as fruit consumption by rats or aridity but the occurrence of an abrupt, island-wide deforestation during the last millennium has become paradigmatic in Rapa Nui. We argue that such a view can be questioned, as it is based on the palynological study of incomplete records, owing to the existence of major sedimentary gaps. Here, we present a multiproxy (pollen, charcoal and geochemistry) study of the Aroi core, the first gap-free sedimentary sequence of the last millennia obtained to date in the island. Our results show changing vegetation patterns under the action of either climatic or anthropogenic drivers, or both, depending on the time interval considered. Palm forests were present in Aroi until the 16th century, when deforestation started, coinciding with fire exacerbation -likely of human origin- and a dry climate. This is the latest deforestation event recorded so far in the island and took place roughly a century before European contact. In comparison to other Easter Island records, this record shows that deforestation was neither simultaneous nor proceeded at the same pace over the whole island. These findings suggest that Easter Island's deforestation was a heterogeneous process in space and time, and highlights the relevance of local catchment traits in the island's environmental and land management history." ;

As Lake Chungara (Central Andean Altiplano, northern Chile) experienced long-term lake-level fluctuations that strongly modified its area:volume ratio, it is an ideal system for exploring the relative roles that long-term climatic shifts and lake morphometry play on biosiliceous lacustrine productivity. In this paper, we review previous data on the percent contents of total organic carbon, total inorganic carbon, total nitrogen, total biogenic silica, isotopic composition of organic matter, carbonates, and diatom frustules, as well as data on the abundance of the chlorophycean Botryococcus braunii in this lake for the period 12,4001300 cal yr BP. We also include new data on organic carbon and biogenic silica mass accumulation rates and the diatom assemblage composition of an offshore core dated using 14C and U/Th. Biosiliceous productivity in Lake Chungara was influenced by shifts in allochthonous nutrient inputs related to variability in precipitation. Humid phases dated at approx. 12,400 to 10,000 and 9600 to 7400 cal yr BP coincide with periods of elevated productivity, whereas decreases in productivity were recorded during arid phases dated at approx. 10,000 to 9600 and 7400 to 3550 cal yr BP (Andean mid-Holocene Aridity Period). However, morphometry-related inlake controls led to a lack of a linear response of productivity to precipitation variability. During the late Glacial to early Holocene, lowstands facilitated complete water column mixing, prompting episodic massive blooms of a large centric diatom, Cyclostephanos cf. andinus. Thus, moderate productivity could be maintained, regardless of aridity, by this phenomenon of morphometric eutrophy during the early history of the lake. The subsequent net increase in lake level introduced modifications in the area of the epilimnion sediments versus the total volume of the epilimnion, preventing complete overturn. Surpassing a certain depth threshold at approx. 8300 cal yr BP caused cessation of the morphometric eutrophy conditions associated with Cyclostephanos cf. andinus superblooms. After 7300 cal yr BP, the lake experienced a decrease in biosiliceous productivity and a change of state that involved a stronger dependence on precipitation variability, with a lesser contribution of diatoms to the total primary productivity. Our results show that the interpretation of lacustrine paleoproductivity records as paleoclimatic archives needs to take into account the effects of changes in the epilimnion sediment area to epilimnion volume ratio in association with lake ontogeny." ;

The results of a multiproxy study on two cores from the center and margin of the Rano Aroi mire, including peat stratigraphy, facies analysis, elemental and isotope geochemistry on bulk organic matter, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanning and macrofossil analysis, were used to infer past water levels and vegetation changes. The chronology was based on 18 14C AMS dates for the upper 8.7m. The extrapolated age for the base of the sequence is 70kyr, which implies that this record is the oldest paleolimnological record on Easter Island. The recovered Rano Aroi sequence consists of a radicel peat formed primarily from the remains of sedges, grasses and Polygonaceae that have accumulated since Marine Isotopic Stage (MIS) 4 (70kyr BP) to the present. From 60 to 40kyr BP (MIS 3), high precipitation/runoff events were recorded as organic mud facies with lighter 13C, low C/N values and high Ti content, indicating higher detritic input to the mire. A gradual shift in 13C bulk organic matter from -14% to -26%, recorded between 50 and 45calkyr BP, suggests a progressive change in local peat-forming vegetation from C4 to C3 plant types. Post-depositional Ca and Fe enrichment during sub-aerial peat exposure and very low sedimentation rates indicate lower water tables during Late MIS 3 (39-31calkyr BP). During MIS 2 (27.8-19calkyr BP), peat production rates were very low, most likely due to cold temperatures, as reconstructed from other Easter Island records during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Geochemical and macrofossil evidence shows that peat accumulation reactivates at approximately 17.5calkyr BP, reaching the highest accumulation rates at 14calkyr BP. Peat accretion decreased from 5.0 to 2.5calkyr BP, coinciding with a regional Holocene aridity phase.

In our SWAT models of the Willow River in Wisconsin and the Sunrise River in Minnesota, we used Pond and Wetland features to capture runoff from about 40% of the area in each watershed. These depressions trapped considerable sediment, yet further reductions in sediment yield were required for calibration and achieved by reducing the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) cropping-practice (P) factor to 0.40 to 0.45. We suggest terminology to describe annual sediment yields at different conceptual spatial scales and show how SWAT output can be partitioned to extract data at each of these scales. These scales range from plot-scale yields calculated with the USLE to watershed-scale yields measured at the outlet. Intermediate scales include field, upland, pre-riverine, and riverine scales, in descending order along the conceptual flow path from plot to outlet. Sediment delivery ratios, when defined as watershed-scale yields as a percentage of plot-scale yields, ranged from 1% for the Willow watershed (717 km) to 7% for the Sunrise watershed (991 km). Sediment delivery ratios calculated from published relations based on watershed area alone were about 5 to 6%, closer to pre-riverine-scale yields in our watersheds." ;

Major element measurements were carried out with an ITRAX XRF core scanner. The Ti record for the last 700 years (1300-2000 AD) was validated as a marker for wash and runoff events (and therefore precipitation) by comparison with historical information and tree ring chronologies related to major droughts events from several areas in Mexico. The register of Ti identifies 21 drought events, six of which are of major intensity and/or duration (i.e. 1365-1384, 1526, 1655-1670, 1818, 1900 and 1930-2000 AD). Spectral analysis of Ti suggests periodicities of 25, 39, 50, 70 and 117 years for the drought events. These periodicities could be related to solar activity and/or climatic factors such as El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The drought events documented at Lake Santa Maria del Oro were compared with records of latitudinal displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (the Ti record from Cariaco Basin in the Atlantic Ocean) and the ENSO index. Some of the main drought events (1448-1435, 1485-1474, 1605-1601, 1673-1655 and 1770-1773 AD) correlate with summer southern migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), while others, i.e.1818, 1832, 1866, 1900, 1939-1929 and 1958-2000 AD, show a correlation with the ENSO index. The events of 1386-1354, 1536-1510, 1579-1585 and 1780-1808 AD correlate positively both with the ENSO index and southern ITCZ migration." ;

Our principal goal was to classify the aquatic systems based on their water variables. A principal component analysis (PCA) of the surface water chemistry data showed that a large fraction of the variance (29%) in water chemistry is explained by conductivity and major ion concentrations. The broad conductivity range, from 168 to 55,300 S cm-1 reflects saline water intrusion affecting coastal aquatic environments, and the steep NW-S precipitation gradient, from ~450 to>3,200 mm year-1. Coastal waterbodies Celestun and Laguna Rosada displayed the highest conductivities. Minimum surface water temperatures of 21.6C were measured in highland lakes, and warmest temperatures, up to 31.7C, were recorded in the lowland waterbodies. Most lakes showed thermal stratification during the sampling period, with the exception of some shallow (<10 m) systems. Lakes Chichancanab, Milagros, and Bacalar displayed sulfate-rich waters. Waters of sinkholes had relatively high conductivities (<3,670 S cm-1) and a broad range of 18O values (-4.1 to +3.8%). Ca, HCO3, and SO4 dominated the waters of the lowland lakes, whereas Na was the dominant cation in highland lakes. Coastal aquatic ecosystems were dominated by Na and Cl. Cluster analysis based on surface water variables classified aquatic environments of the lowlands and highlands into three groups: (1) lowland lakes, ponds, wetlands, and coastal waterbodies (2) highland lakes, and (3) sinkholes and rivers. A broad trophic state gradient was recorded, ranging from the eutrophic Lake Amatitlan and the Timul sinkhole to oligotrophic Laguna Ayarza, with the highest water transparency (11.4 m). We used major and trace elements in surface sediments to assess pollution of waterbodies. Lakes Amatitlan, Atescatempa, El Rosario, Cayucon, Chacan-Lara, La Misteriosa, rivers Subin and Rio Dulce, the wetland Jamolun, and the sinkhole Peten de Monos showed evidence of pollution and urban development. Their surface sediments displayed high concentrations of As, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Se, Zn, and Zr, which suggest moderate to strong pollution.  Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010." ;

The results indicate the occurrence of magnetite, and probably also pyrrhotite, in sediments accumulated between ca. 26 and 13 cal ka BP in a proglacial lake environment. These minerals also appear to dominate the magnetic assemblage of Palaeozoic rocks from the lake catchment. This indicates that sedimentation was then driven by the erosion of glacial flour, which suffered minimal chemical transformation due to a rapid and short routing to the lake. A sharp change in magnetic properties observed in the lake sediments between 13 and 12.6 cal ka BP reflects the rapid retreat of glaciers from the lake catchment. Sediments from the upper half of the studied sequence, accumulated after 12.6 cal ka BP in a lacustrine environment with strong fluvial influence, contain magnetite and smaller amounts of maghemite and greigite. We suggest that greigite grew authigenically under anoxic conditions caused by enhanced accumulation of organic matter into the lake. The occurrence of maghemite in these sediments suggests pedogenic activity in the then deglaciated lake catchment before the erosion and transportation of detrital material into the lake." ;

A novel sea-surface temperature proxy has been proposed for marine systems based on membrane lipids of marine crenarchaeota (the TEX86-tetraether index of tetraethers with 86 carbon atoms). Analysis of archaeal membrane lipids in core-top sediments from a diverse suite of lacustrine systems suggests the ubiquitous occurrence of low-temperature crenarchaeota in lake systems as well. Application of the TEX86 proxy in these lacustrine systems indicates that it is valid in lake environments, and the calibration of TEX86 in lacustrine systems is similar to that in the marine environment. This proxy will provide an independent continental paleotemperature tool that will allow palleoclimatologists to address fundamental questions about temperature variability in continental environments and its relationship to climate change.  2004 Geological Society of America." ;

Proxy data and dates from palynological, limnological, geomorphological archives were compared with data recovered from the archaeological sites in high altitude basins, intermediate ravines and piemontane paleowetlands. Due to exceptionally favorable conditions, numerous Early Holocene archaeological sites were found. In contrast, the lack of occupations in previously populated areas suggests a decline in human activity during the arid mid-Holocene. In this context, two key concepts are introduced: ecorefuge or ecological refuge, and archaeological silence (silencio arqueologico). The first refers to the particular favorable locations occupied by human groups during the mid-Holocene. The second provides a better understanding about the impact of the arid interval during this period on human adaptations in the most barren territories of the New World." ;

Mineralogy, elemental geochemistry, and magnetic properties provide information about variations in provenance of allogenic lithic material in last-glacial-age, quartz-rich sediment in Bear Lake. Grain-size data from the siliciclastic fraction of late-glacial to Holocene carbonate-rich sediments provide information about variations in lake level. For the quartz-rich lower unit, which was deposited while the Bear River fl owed into and out of the lake, four source areas are recognized on the basis of modern fluvial samples with contrasting properties that reflect differences in bedrock geology and in magnetite content from dust. One of these areas is underlain by hematite-rich Uinta Mountain Group rocks in the headwaters of the Bear River. Although Uinta Mountain Group rocks make up a small fraction of the catchment, hematite-rich material from this area is an important component of the lower unit. This material is interpreted to be glacial fl our. Variations in the input of glacial flour are interpreted as having caused quasi-cyclical variations in mineralogical and elemental concentrations, and in magnetic properties within the lower unit. The carbonate-rich younger unit was deposited under conditions similar to those of the modern lake, with the Bear River largely bypassing the lake. For two cores taken in more than 30 m of water, median grain sizes in this unit range from 6 m to more than 30 m, with the coarsest grain sizes associated with beach or shallow-water deposits. Similar grain-size variations are observed as a function of water depth in the modern lake and provide the basis for interpreting the core grain-size data in terms of lake level.

Here we present the first continental evidence for climatically caused changes in a methane gas hydrate reservoir. The organic carbon stable isotope record from Lake Baikal during the past 130 000 years registers regular emissions of isotopically light carbon by the occurrence of distinct negative shifts of 3-5 at every major orbitally forced cold-to-warm climatic transition during the past 130 000 years, including marine oxygen isotope stage boundaries 6/5e, 5d/5c, 5b/5a and 2/1. We conclude that these emissions were associated with decomposition of sedimentary clathrates, widespread in the Baikal basin. Among potential hypotheses to account for these methane episodes, the most probable appears to be hydrate dissociation due to deglacial warming of lake water. We estimate that as much as 12-33 Tg of methane could have been released with each episode. By recording the systematically recurring episodes of massive methane clathrate decomposition closely linked with the northern hemisphere temperatures during major orbital warmings, the new Baikal 13C record provides further evidence for the potential involvement of clathrate reservoir in rapid deglacial rises of atmospheric methane levels.  2003 Elsevier B.V.

It is characterized by an interplay between volcanic and climatic controls on the lake sediment environmental proxies. Initial lake ontogeny was disrupted by deposition of the Saksunarvatn tephra (10.3 ka) followed by unusually slow ontogeny for 2 ka. Principal component analysis defines three climate zones between 8 and 1 ka. Quasi-stabilization and warm summer proxies between 8 and 5.7 ka define Holocene Thermal Maximum conditions. A subtle shift to cooler summers between 5.7 and 4.2 ka is interpreted as early Neoglaciation, intensifying after 4.2 ka. Following settlement of Iceland (1.1 ka) anthropogenic signals overprint the climate record. Throughout the record short-term variability is attributed to tephra fall events in the catchment from nearby explosive volcanism, whereas centennial- and millennial-scale changes are attributed to climate. When compared with other Icelandic lakes, environmental proxies from Vestra Gislholtsvatn indicate less variability albeit similar timing of environmental change, suggesting a relatively stable flow of the Irminger Current along the south coast of Iceland compared with a more variable flow of warm Atlantic surface water along the western and northern coasts of Iceland after 8 ka." ;

High-resolution analyses of fossil pollen from one core locality revealed a continuously shifting sequence of thermally dependent forest assemblages, ranging between two endmembers: subtropical oak-tupelo-bald cypress-gum forest and high boreal spruce-pine forest. Sedimentary textural evidence indicates fluvial, paludal, and loess deposition, and paleosol formation, representing sequential freshwater to subaerial environments in which this record was deposited. Its total agedepth model, based on radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence ages, ranges from terrestrial oxygen isotope stages (OIS) 6 to 1. The particular core sub-interval presented here is correlative in trend and timing to that portion of the oxygen isotope sequence common among several Greenland ice cores: interstades GI2 to GI24 ( OIS25 d). This site thus provides the first evidence for an essentially complete series of DansgaardOeschger climate events in the MAR. These data reveal that the ~ 100,000 yr preceding the Late Glacial and Holocene in the MAR of North America were characterized by frequently and dynamically changing climate states, and by vegetation shifts that closely tracked the Greenland paleoclimate sequence." ;

ns3:aa3fe2c2\-63a4\-3788\-9a8a\-824d20e11ede	ns2:abstracttext	"We have investigated the variability of the magnetic properties of surface sediments across eight Minnesota lake basins. The measured magnetic properties are controlled by the competing fluxes of allochthonous and autochthonous magnetic particles, and differ according to location in the basin. Shoreline sediments are dominated by detrital magnetic particles, whereas littoral and profundal sediments are characterized by a combination of bacterial magnetosomes and detrital particles. The position of the oxic-anoxic interface, which may occur in the water or within the sediment column, controls the depth at which living magnetotactic bacteria occur, and determines the degree of preservation of their magnetosome chains in the surface sediment. The preservation potential of undisturbed chains is higher for bacterial magnetite formed at the top of the sediment column in the littoral area than for magnetosomes originating in the water column in the profundal area. Bacterial magnetite in the profundal facies will contain a higher proportion of chains collapsed during settlement through the water column to the lake bottom. This process increases the fraction of interacting magnetosomes, which in turn artificially lowers the ARM ratio (ARM/IRM), which ceases to be a reliable grain size indicator in the profundal environment. Our results indicate that a holistic approach to interpreting limnologically-derived paleoecological data should be employed. Specifically, a thorough understanding of evolving and interrelated factors such as basin morphology and limnologic conditions is crucial for a more confident interpretation of the sedimentary record in terms of environmental conditions at the time of sediment deposition.  2013 Elsevier B.V." ;

We mapped and dated these paleowetland deposits at three presently waterless locations near Salar de Punta Negra (24.5 degrees S) on the western slope of the Andes. Elevated groundwater levels supported phreatic discharge into wetlands during two periods: 15,900 to similar to 13,800 and 12,700 to similar to 9700 cal yr BP. Dense concentrations of lithic artifacts testify to the presence of paleoindians around the wetlands late in the second wet phase (11,000?-9700 cal yr BP). Water tables dropped below the surface before 15,900 and since 8 100 cal yr BP, and briefly between similar to 13,800 and 12,700 cal yr BP. This temporal pattern is repeated, with some slight differences, in rodent middens from the study area, in both paleowetland and rodent midden deposits north and south of the study area, and in lake level fluctuations on the adjacent Bolivian Altiplano. The regional synchroneity of these changes points to a strengthening of the South American Monsoon - which we term the \"Central Andean Pluvial Event\"- in two distinct intervals (15,90013,800 and 12,700-9700 cal yr BP), probably induced by steepened SST gradients across the tropical Pacific (i.e., La Nina-like conditions).

Andrew and Heart Lakes are located 10 km apart; their contrasting physical characteristics cause the sedimentary organic matter to respond differently to storms. Their records were synchronized using correlated tephra beds. Sedimentation rates increased between 4.0 and 3.5 ka in both lakes. Over the instrumental period, Andrew Lake biogenic-silica content (BSi) is most strongly correlated with winter sunlight availability, which influences photosynthetic production, and river input, which influences the dilution of BSi by mineral matter. Heart Lake BSi is likely affected by wind-driven remobilization of sediment, as suggested by correlations among BSi, the North Pacific Index, and winter storminess. The results indicate relatively stormy conditions from 9.6 to 4.0 ka, followed by drying between 4.0 and 2.7 ka, with the driest conditions from 2.7 to 1.5 ka. The stormiest period was between AD 500 and 1200, then drying from 1150 to 1500 and more variable until 1850. This record of Holocene storminess fills a major gap at the center of action for North Pacific wintertime climate.  2014 University of Washington." ;

Emissions of Hg from mineral reservoirs and recycling between soil/biomass, oceans, and the atmosphere are fundamental to the global Hg cycle, yet past emissions from anthropogenic and natural sources are not fully constrained. We use a sediment core from Yanacocha, a headwater lake in southeastern Peru, to study the anthropogenic and natural controls on atmospheric Hg deposition during the Holocene. From 12.3 to 3.5 ka, Hg fluxes in the record are relatively constant (mean  1: 1.4  0.6 g m-2 a-1). Past Hg deposition does not correlate with changes in regional temperature and precipitation or with most large volcanic events that occurred regionally (~300-400 km from Yanacocha) and globally. In 1450 B.C. (3.4 ka), Hg fluxes abruptly increased and reached the Holocene-maximum flux (6.7 g m-2 a-1) in 1200 B.C., concurrent with a ~100 year peak in Fe and chalcophile metals (As, Ag, Tl) and the presence of framboidal pyrite. Continuously elevated Hg fluxes from 1200 to 500 B.C. suggest a protracted mining-dust source near Yanacocha that is identical in timing to documented pre-Incan cinnabar mining in central Peru. During Incan and Colonial time (A.D. 1450-1650), Hg deposition remains elevated relative to background levels but lower relative to other Hg records from sediment cores in central Peru, indicating a limited spatial extent of preindustrial Hg emissions. Hg fluxes from A.D. 1980 to 2011 (4.0  1.0 g m-2 a-1) are 3.0  1.5 times greater than preanthropogenic fluxes.

The core was taken at 41.95N, 111.31W, near the depocenter of the 60-m-deep, spring-fed, alkaline lake, where carbonate-bearing sediment has accumulated continuously. Chronological control is poor but indicates an average sedimentation rate of 0.54 mm yr-1. Analyses have been completed at multi-centennial to millennial scales, including (in order of decreasing temporal resolution) sediment magnetic properties, oxygen and carbon isotopes on bulk-sediment carbonate, organic- and inorganiccarbon contents, palynology; mineralogy (X-ray diffraction), strontium isotopes on bulk carbonate, ostracode taxonomy, oxygen and carbon isotopes on ostracodes, and diatom assemblages. Massive silty clay and marl constitute most of the core, with variable carbonate content (average = 31  19%) and oxygen-isotopic values (18O ranging from -18 to -5 in bulk carbonate). These variations, as well as fluctuations of biological indicators, reflect changes in the water and sediment discharged from the glaciated headwaters of the dominant tributary, Bear River, and the processes that influenced sediment delivery to the core site, including lake-level changes. Although its influence has varied, Bear River has remained a tributary to Bear Lake during most of the last quarter-million years. The lake disconnected from the river and, except for a few brief excursions, retracted into a topographically closed basin during global interglaciations (during parts of marine isotope stages 7, 5, and 1). These intervals contain up to 80% endogenic aragonite with high 18O values (average = -5.8  1.7), indicative of strongly evaporitic conditions. Interglacial intervals also are dominated by small, benthic/tychoplanktic fragilarioid species indicative of reduced habitat availability associated with low lake levels, and they contain increased high-desert shrub and Juniperus pollen and decreased forest and forest-woodland pollen. The 87Sr 86Sr values (>0.7100) also increase, and the ratio of quartz to dolomite decreases, as expected in the absence of Bear River in flow. The changing paleoenvironments inferred from BL00-1 generally are consistent with other regional and global records of glacialinterglacial fluctuations; the diversity of paleoenvironmental conditions inferred from BL00-1 also reflects the influence of catchment-scale processes.

The geochemistry and mineralogy of endogenic calcium carbonate deposited in deep water, and stratigraphic studies of shore-zone deposits, provide evidence of millennial-scale lake-level fluctuations that had amplitudes of about 50 m between 30 and 10 ka. Falling-lake events occurred at 21, 18.519, 17.5, 1615.5, 1413, and 10 ka (radiocarbon years) synchronously with the terminations of Heinrich events H1 and H2 and other smaller scale iceberg-rafting events (a, b, c, and Younger Dryas) in the North Atlantic Ocean. The Lake Bonneville results thus support other climate records that suggest that late Pleistocene millennial-scale climate change was global in extent. The size and shape of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, which determined the mean positions of storm tracks, may have been the primary control on late Pleistocene water budgets of Great Basin lakes." ;

Myr. BP) in the northeastern Russian Arctic. The paper describes vegetation and climate fluctuations between ~. 2.15 and 2.10. Myr. BP as inferred from palynological data. Biome reconstructions indicate that throughout this interval the tundra (TUND) biome generally has higher affinity scores as compared to cold steppe (STEP) or cold deciduous forest (CLDE). An exception is the climatic optimum between ~. 2.139 and 2.131. Myr. BP, coinciding with Marine Isotope Stage 81 (approximately the Reunion Subchron), when the CLDE biome has the highest scores. Landscape-openness indices suggest that more closed vegetation characterized most of the interval between 2.146 and 2.127. Myr. BP, when deciduous forest and shrubs expanded in the regional vegetation and climate was relatively warm and wet. Peaks in green algal colonies (Botryococcus) and Zygnema-type spores ~. 2.150-2.146, ~. 2.131-2.123, and ~. 2.112-2.102. Myr. BP indicate expansions of shallow-water habitats and lowered lake levels. Comparisons with biome reconstructions from other interglacial intervals at Lake El'gygytgyn suggest that precession-related summer insolation intensity and obliquity-related duration of summer daylight are major controls on the onset of interglaciations, whereas obliquity probably plays a more significant role on vegetation succession at northern high latitudes during the Pleistocene." ;

Oxygen isotopes show that Williams and Shingobee Lakes, located in the same watershed but with different positions along a hydrologic gradient, were connected before 9.8 ka as part of a larger lake, Lake Willobee. From 9.8-7.7 ka, the level of Lake Willobee fell as a result of glacial retreat and increasing evaporation, leaving small separated basins. Further decreases in lake level after 7.7 ka due to increasing aridity triggered the inflow of ground water in Williams Lake at about 7 ka, and in Shingobee Lake at about 5 ka. After 4 ka effective moisture increased. The carbon-isotope record reflects changes in vegetation with higher 13C values during the prairie period (7.7-4 ka) and lower values during preceding and succeeding forest periods. The differences in timing of hydrological events show that the biotic and geochemical response of the lakes to climate variations is mediated by their hydrologic systems. The response may be strongly spatially heterogeneous and can result in contrasting information from geochemical and biotic proxies from the same paleorecord.  2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A lack of reliable chronology has, however, been a major obstacle to fully utilizing the Baikal archive for time scales beyond about 4-5 Myr. In this paper we use the distribution of 10Be to establish a new chronology for the longest core drilled in Lake Baikal so far. The 10Be-based chronology spans the last 8 Myr and provides better constraints on sedimentation rates and consequently on an east-west tectonic extension in the lake, which has been apparently coeval with other rifts in Asia that are related to the Tibetan plateau uplift. Our data also show higher 10Be flux in the sediment section older then 5 Myr compared with the younger period. This can be explained partly by warm and humid climatic conditions of the Miocene and partly by a high cosmic ray flux to the Earth resulting from possible low geomagnetic field intensity during that time." ;

An eyewitness reported a large wave on the surface of Owens Lake, presumably initiated by the earthquake. Physical evidence of this event is found in cores and trenches from Owens Lake, including soft-sediment deformation and fault offsets. A graded pebbly sand truncates these features, possibly over most of the lake floor, reflecting the 'tsunami' wave. Confirmation of the timing of the event is provided by abnormally high lead concentrations in the sediment immediately above and below these proposed earthquake deposits derived from lead-smelting plants that operated near the eastern lake margin from 1869-1876. The bottom velocity in the deepest part of the lake needed to transport the coarsest grain sizes in the graded pebbly sand provides an estimate of the minimum initial 'tsunami' wave height at 37 cm. This is less than the wave height calculated from long-wave numerical models (about 55 cm) using average fault displacement during the earthquake. Two other graded sand deposits associated with soft-sediment deformation in the Owens Lake record are less than 3000 years old, and are interpreted as evidence of older earthquake and tsunami events. Offsets of the Owens Valley fault elsewhere in the valley indicate that at least two additional large earthquakes occurred during the Holocene, which is consistent with our observations in this lacustrine record.

Although long-term precessionally-driven changes in temperature and precipitation have been demonstrated using tropical sediment records, responses to abrupt climate changes, e.g. the cooling of Heinrich stadials or warmings of the deglaciation, are poorly documented. The best predictions of future forest responses to ongoing warming will rely on evaluating the influences of both abrupt and long-term climate changes on past ecosystems. A sedimentary sequence recovered from Lake Peten-Itza, Guatemalan lowlands, provided a natural archive of environmental history. Pollen and charcoal analyses were used to reconstruct the vegetation and climate history of the area during the last 86,000 years. We found that vegetation composition and air temperature were strongly influenced by millennial-scale changes in the North Atlantic Ocean. Whereas Greenland warm interstadials were associated with warm and relatively wet conditions in the Central American lowlands, cold Greenland stadials, especially those associated with Heinrich events, caused extremely dry and cold conditions. Even though the vegetation seemed to have been highly resilient, plant associations without modern analogs emerged mostly following sharp climate pulses of either warmth or cold, and were paralleled by exceptionally high rates of ecological change. Although pulses of temperature change are evident in this 86,000-year record none matched the rates projected for the 21st Century. According to our findings, the ongoing rapid warming will cause no-modern-analog communities, which given the improbability of returning to lower-than-modern CO2 levels, anthropogenic barriers to migration, and increased anthropogenic fires, will pose immense threats to the biodiversity of the region." ;

Downcore data include chironomid (Diptera: Chironomidae) assemblage data and total organic carbon, nitrogen, and biogenic silica content. Sample scores from detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) of chironomid assemblage data are well correlated with measured temperatures at Stykkisholmur over the 170 year instrumental record, indicating that chironomid assemblages at Stora Vioarvatn have responded sensitively to past temperature changes. DCA scores appear to be useful for quantitatively inferring past temperatures at this site. In contrast, a quantitative chironomid-temperature transfer function developed for northwestern Iceland does a relatively poor job of reconstructing temperature shifts, possibly due to the lake's large size and depth relative to the calibration sites or to the limited resolution of the subfossil taxonomy. The pre-instrumental climate history inferred from chironomids and other paleolimnological proxies is supported by prior inferences from historical documents, glacier reconstructions, and paleoceanographic studies. Much of the first millennium AD was relatively warm, with temperatures comparable to warm decades of the twentieth century. Temperatures during parts of the tenth and eleventh centuries AD may have been comparably warm. Biogenic silica concentrations declined, carbon:nitrogen ratios increased, and some chironomid taxa disappeared from the lake between the thirteenth and nineteenth centuries, recording the decline of temperatures into the Little Ice Age, increasing soil erosion, and declining lake productivity. All the proxy reconstructions indicate that the most severe Little Ice Age conditions occurred during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a period historically associated with maximum sea-ice and glacier extent around Iceland.  2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

If the environmental influence on the species composition of their communities is robustly quantified, past changes in ostracode communities reflected in fossil assemblages can be used for paleo-environmental reconstruction. We analyzed ostracode assemblages in recently deposited surface sediments from 56 lakes in western and central Mongolia, and simultaneously recorded local water chemistry and solute concentration in order to elucidate the distribution of individual ostracode species in relation to these broad environmental gradients. Multivariate analysis indicated that the species variation in ostracode assemblages could be mainly attributed to variations in percent calcium (%Ca) relative to total cation content, mean annual precipitation, calcium concentration, alkalinity, percent bicarbonate relative to total anion content, and mean July temperature. This matches well with the results of a similar analysis on presence/absence data of living ostracodes in nearshore samples, even though some differences exist between the faunal composition of both datasets. The documented response of ostracode species to environmental variation tracks the typical solute evolutionary pathway for surface waters in this region, characterized by calcite precipitation and consequent depletion in dissolved calcium. Hence, the best quantitative inference model (WA-PLS model with Rjack2=0.70, RMSEP = 0.40) for paleolimnological application was obtained for %Ca. Comparison between this model and a specific conductance (SC) inference model based on the same dataset, and based on ostracode datasets from different regions, indicated that the %Ca inference model suffers less than the SC inference model from a step-change in reconstructed values. The statistical power of different inference models based on Mongolian ostracodes are variously affected by the common dominance of a single euryhaline species (Limnocythere inopinata), limited faunal turnover in the freshwater portion of the salinity gradient, and the bimodal frequency distribution of SC among regional lakes. The latter probably represents true scarcity of lakes with intermediate salinity rather than a biased representation in our dataset. In a broader context of ostracode ecology, and with respect to regional paleolimnological applications, we highlight the potential of fossil Mongolian ostracode assemblages to trace past hydrological shifts associated with changes in groundwater inflow.  2011 Elsevier Ltd." ;

The first-order low-frequency trend in varve thickness reflects increased glacial erosion through the Late Holocene, reaching a peak during the Little Ice Age (LIA). Superimposed on this trend are large inter-annual to decadal fluctuations in varve thickness that we suggest reflect variability in climate parameters that determine the efficiency of the fluvial transport system to deliver glacially eroded sediment to the lake each year. We use spectral analysis to test whether regular high-frequency cyclicity in varve thickness exists in the 3-ka record after removing the low-frequency variability. Spectral analyses from three sediment cores recovered from the lake show essentially the same periods of 2.8-3.4, 13, 35-40 and 85-93, for the overlapping ~900-year period. Additionally, cycles of 55, 130 and 290 years are found in the spectrum for the 3000-year record that do not show up in the spectra for the shorter cores. Some of these cycles show similar variability to those of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). This relationship is supported by a significant correlation between varve thickness and both the NAO (precipitation) and AMO (summer temperature) indices over the 180-year instrumental period. NAO cyclicities (2-15 years) are weakly expressed in the first half of the record, increase between 600 and 1000 AD, decrease in strength during medieval time, and are most strongly expressed between 1300 AD and the early 20th century. AMO cyclicities (50 to 130 years) are also relatively weak in the first half of the record, becoming quite strong between 600 and 1000 AD and again between 1100 and 1500 AD, but are essentially absent through the peak of the LIA, between 1500 and 1900 AD, a time when strong cyclicities of about 35 years appear.  2013 Elsevier Ltd." ;

Taxonomic and quantitative analyses along with isotopic and chemical studies of the extant ostracod fauna indicate that distinct ostracod associations can be identified as a function of conductivity. Three ostracod associations can be distinguished: (1) springs, ponds and small creeks, characterized by low conductivity (e.g. 1015scm-1); (2) lakes and permanent ponds, characterized by medium conductivity (e.g. 1625scm-1) and (3) ephemeral lacustrine environments, generally characterized by higher conductivity (e.g. 16480scm-1) These modern ostracod associations were also identified in older sequences from sediments outcropping in the Laguna Cari-Laufquen current shoreline, as well as in sediment cores from Lago Cardiel. The predominance of Limnocythere rionegroensis Cusminsky & Whatley in the Cari-Laufquen sections suggests the development of a saline and turbid lake during the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene, and thus higher precipitation at these latitudes. Changes in ostracod abundance and associations have been observed in Lago Cardiel during the last approximately 16000 calibrated years BP. Conductivity is known to change as a function of the ratio of precipitation to evaporation and a decrease in conductivity from the Late Pleistocene to the Middle Holocene suggests substantial hydrological variations (i.e. increase of the precipitation/evaporation ratio suggests minor conductivity). These two examples show that ostracods provide an excellent proxy for interpreting palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental changes in Patagonia.  2011 The Linnean Society of London." ;

In this study, we compare the transition into (ca. 9000-7000 yr ago) and out of (ca. 5000-2500 yr ago) the mid-Holocene (MH) period at Kimble Pond and Sharkey Lake, located along the prairie forest ecotone in south-central Minnesota, using high resolution ( 5-36 yr) sampling of pollen, charcoal, sediment magnetic and loss-on-ignition properties. Changes in vegetation were asymmetrical with increasing aridity being marked by a pronounced shift from woodland/forest-dominated landscape to a more open mix of grassland and woodland/savanna. In contrast, at the end of the MH, grassland remained an important component of the landscape despite increasing effective moisture, and high charcoal influxes (median 2.7-4.0 vs. 0.6-1.7 mm2 cm- 2 yr- 1 at start of MH) suggest the role of fire in limiting woodland expansion. Asymmetric vegetation responses, variation among and within proxies, and the near-absence of fire today suggest caution in using changes associated with mid-Holocene aridity at the prairie forest boundary as an analog for future responses to global warming.  2006 University of Washington." ;

Two different experimental techniques were used to determine the fractionation factors and the rate of S isotope exchange between pyrite and constituent aqueous species, H2S and SO4; (1) closed system gold capsule pyriteH2S exchange experiments and (2) complimentary time-series experiments at 300 and 350 C, 500 bars using flexible gold cell hydrothermal equipment, which allowed monitoring the multiple S isotope composition of dissolved S species during pyrite precipitation and subsequent recrystallization. The three isotope technique was applied to the multiple S isotope data to demonstrate equilibrium S isotope fractionation between pyrite and H2S. Results at 350 C indicate ln 34  Pyrite / H 2 S = 1.9 and ln 33  Pyrite / H 2 S = 1.0. The ln 34  Pyrite / H 2 S is not only different in magnitude but also in sign from the commonly used value of 1 from Ohmoto and Rye (1979). This experimental study also demonstrated initial S isotope disequilibrium amongst the aqueous S-species and pyrite during rapid precipitation, despite aqueous speciation indicating pyrite saturation at all stages. Textural, crystallographic, and S isotope interpretations suggest that pyrite formed by means of the FeS pathway. The initial S isotope disequilibrium between formed pyrite and dissolved S-species was effectively erased and approached isotopic equilibrium upon recrystallization during the course of 4297 h. Interpretation of seafloor hydrothermal vent sulfides using the revised equilibrium 34S/32S fractionation between pyrite and H2S suggests that pyrite is close to S isotope equilibrium with vent H2S, contrary to previous conclusions. The experimental data reported here broaden the range of pyrite formation mechanisms at seafloor hydrothermal vents, in that mineral formation pathway and equilibration rates need to be considered to account for the well-recognized S isotope variability that often characterizes these systems." ;

However, fish fossils have never been used to examine changes in African Great Lake vertebrate aquatic communities nor as indicators of changing paleolimnological conditions. Here we present results of analyses of a Lake Malawi core dating back ~144ka that describe and quantify the composition and abundance of fish fossils and report on stable carbon isotopic data (13C) from fish scale, bone and tooth fossils. We compared the fossil 13C values to 13C values from extant fish communities to determine whether carbon isotope ratios can be used as indicators of inshore versus offshore pelagic fish assemblages. Fossil buccal teeth, pharyngeal teeth and mills, vertebra and scales from the fish families Cichlidae and Cyprinidae occur in variable abundance throughout the core. Carbon isotopic ratios from numerous fish fossils throughout the core range between -7.2 and -27.5%, similar to those found in contemporary Lake Malawi benthic and pelagic fish faunas. These results are the first paleo-record of fish fossils from a Lake Malawi sediment core and the first reported 13C values from Lake Malawi fish fossils. This approach provides a new methodology and framework for interpreting pelagic versus inshore fish faunas, lake level fluctuations and the evolution of the Lake Malawi fish assemblages.  2010 Elsevier B.V." ;

(2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 104:16416-16421]. This resulted in extraordinarily low lake levels, even in Africa's deepest lakes. On the basis of well dated paleoecological records from Lake Malawi, which reflect both local and regional conditions, we show that this aridity had severe consequences for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. During the most arid phase, there was extremely low pollen production and limited charred-particle deposition, indicating insufficient vegetation to maintain substantial fires, and the Lake Malawi watershed experienced cool, semidesert conditions (<400 mm/yr precipitation). Fossil and sedimentological data show that Lake Malawi itself, currently 706 m deep, was reduced to an approximately 125 m deep saline, alkaline, well mixed lake. This episode of aridity was far more extreme than any experienced in the Afrotropics during the Last Glacial Maximum (approximately 35-15 ka). Aridity diminished after 95 ka, lake levels rose erratically, and salinity/alkalinity declined, reaching near-modern conditions after 60 ka. This record of lake levels and changing limnological conditions provides a framework for interpreting the evolution of the Lake Malawi fish and invertebrate species flocks. Moreover, this record, coupled with other regional records of early Late Pleistocene aridity, places new constraints on models of Afrotropical biogeographic refugia and early modern human population expansion into and out of tropical Africa." ;

To infer past tropical vegetation dynamics, understanding modern pollenvegetation relationships is required, but understanding effects of different sampling media between calibration datasets and palaeorecords is also needed. This is especially true when palaeorecords are derived from bogs or lakes with boggy shores and common wetland plants share the same pollen taxon with important upland plants that distinguish tropical vegetation types (e.g., Poaceae and Plantago). We assessed modern pollenvegetation relationships around an upper cloud forest line in the Hawaiian Islands and tested the utility of a modern pollen calibration dataset derived from 88 surface soil samples when applied in 10 test wetland sites more typical of palaeorecords. We assessed over- and under-representation of pollen/spore taxa with a direct comparison to plant abundance and derived several metrics from the pollen/spore assemblages  analogs, ordinations, relative abundance of life forms, and ratios of life forms. We used the Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) to (1) compare metric performance at distinguishing vegetation around the upper forest line, (2) assess whether excluding wetland taxa significantly affected metric performance, and (3) test the accuracy of vegetation inference. Pollenvegetation relationships were influenced by great ecological breadth and over- or under-representation of pollen and spores, which could be explained by pollination syndrome (wind vs. animal), grain/spore mass and upslope transport in winds. However, we found no evidence that upslope transport significantly blurred the upper-forest-line signal here, likely because winds are predominantly perpendicular to slope, and vertically constrained by the trade-wind inversion. Pollen from Poaceae and Plantago characterizes vegetation around this Hawaiian upper forest line and dominates wetland assemblages. Removing wetland taxa from the modern pollen calibration dataset levied no cost on a metric's performance, and greatly reduced the incidence of inaccurate vegetation inference in test sites. Minor error rates remained when rare, over-represented, or ecologically broad types were used in isolation. Overall, this study demonstrates that inferring forest line position from fossil pollen/spore assemblages requires careful consideration because (1) differences in sampling media between the modern calibration dataset and palaeorecords create opportunity for inaccurate vegetation inference and (2) some metrics perform better than others." ;

A variety of paleorecords indicate that the onset of prolonged dry conditions in this region occurred as rapidly as 300 yr during the early Holocene, with a subsequent increase in moisture occurring rapidly in the late Holocene. Here, we report a 9500 yr multiproxy sediment record from Deming Lake, Minnesota, USA, that demonstrates only subtle dynamics during rapid climate changes that caused vegetation in the catchment to shift among pine forest, open grassland, and deciduous forest. The most substantial changes in ecosystem properties immediately followed deglaciation of the landscape, formation of the lake, and initial development of pine forests. In contrast, there were only muted responses to pronounced mid-Holocene climate changes that caused vegetation in the catchment to switch from pine forest to open grassland (ca. 8000 yr B.P.), and then deciduous forest (ca. 5400 yr B.P.). The flux of organic and inorganic terrigenous material, the processing of carbon, and catchment erosion changed rapidly during the most recent shift at 3300 yr B.P. to the modern pine forest. These changes coincided with the onset of meromictic conditions that influenced internal lake dynamics. However, the terrestrial influence on the lake sedimentary record gradually diminished over time, indicating a trajectory of increasing catchment stabilization that was relatively impervious to dramatic regional climate changes. The relative complacency of the Deming Lake record during the late Holocene indicates relative resistance to abrupt climate change at later stages of ecosystem development." ;

Despite the abundance of continental records of Holocene climate, few have sufficient chronological control and sampling resolution to compare with the Greenland findings. But annually laminated sediments (varves) from lakes can provide high-resolution continental palaeoclimate data with secure chronologies. Here we present analyses of varved sediments from Deep Lake in Minnesota, USA. Trends in the stable oxygen-isotope composition of the sedimentary carbonate indicate a pronounced climate cooling from 8.9 to 8.3 kyr before present, probably characterized by increased outbreaks of polar air, decreased precipitation temperatures, and a higher fraction of the annual precipitation falling as snow. The abrupt onset of this climate reversal, over several decades, was probably caused by a reorganization of atmospheric circulation and cooling of the Arctic airmass in summer that resulted from the final collapse of the Laurentide ice near Hudson Bay and the discharge of icebergs from the Quebec and Keewatin centres into the Tyrell Sea. The timing and duration of this climate reversal suggest that it is distinct from the prominent widespread cold snap that occurred 8,200 years ago in Greenland and other regions. No shifts in the oxygen-isotope composition of sediment carbonate occurred at 8.2 kyr before present at Deep Lake, but varve thickness increased dramatically, probably as a result of increased deposition of aeolian dust. Taken together, our data suggest that two separate regional-scale climate reversals occurred between 9,000 and 8,000 years ago, and that they were driven by different mechanisms." ;

Prior to about 11.2 cal. ka, most of these lakes and wetlands were interconnected to form glacial Lake Willobee, which apparently formed when a debris flow dammed the Shingobee River. Between 11.2 and 8.5 cal. ka, the level of Lake Willobee fell as a result of breaching of the dam, transforming the deep lake into the existing lakes and wetlands. Analyses of a 9-m core from Little Shingobee Lake (LSL-B), and lacustrine sediments under 3.3 m of peat in a 17-m core from Little Shingobee Fen (LSF-10), show that the dominant components are allogenic clastic material, and endogenic CaCO 3 and organic matter. In both cores almost all of the iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) are incorporated in endogenic minerals, presumed to be X-ray amorphous oxyhydroxide minerals, that occur in significant quantities throughout the cores; almost no Fe and Mn are contributed from detrital aluminosilicate minerals. This suggests that, for most of the Holocene, the allogenic watershed contributions to lake chemistry were minor compared to the dissolved mineral load. In addition, prior to 3.5 cal. ka, pollen zone boundaries coincide with large changes in lake-sediment mineralogy, indicating that both landscape and climate processes were linked to early- and mid-Holocene lake chemistry. The pollen time series, with sequential domination by spruce, pine, sagebrush-oak, birch-oak and, finally, white pine is typical of the region and reflects the changing location of the prairie-forest transition zone over time. These changes in vegetation had some profound effects on the geochemistry of the lake waters." ;

Paleomagnetic data exhibit a geomagnetic feature that possibly occurred during the Laschamp excursion (ca. 40 ka). Although the feature does not exhibit excursional behavior (40 departure from the expected value), it might provide an additional age constraint for the sequence. Temporal changes in salinity, which are likely related to changes in freshwater input (mainly through the Bear River) or evaporation, are indicated by variations in mineral magnetic properties. These changes are represented by intervals with preserved detrital Fe-oxide minerals and with varying degrees of diagenetic alteration, including sulfidization. On the basis of these changes, the Bear Lake sequence is divided into seven mineral magnetic zones. The differing magnetic mineralogies among these zones reflect changes in deposition, preservation, and formation of magnetic phases related to factors such as lake level, river input, and water chemistry. The occurrence of greigite and pyrite in the lake sediments corresponds to periods of higher salinity. Pyrite is most abundant in intervals of highest salinity, suggesting that the extent of sulfidization is limited by the availability of SO42-. During MIS 2 (zone II), Bear Lake transgressed to capture the Bear River, resulting in deposition of glacially derived hematite-rich detritus from the Uinta Mountains. Millennial-scale variations in the hematite content of Bear Lake sediments during the last glacial maximum (zone II) resemble Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) oscillations and Heinrich events (within dating uncertainties), suggesting that the influence of millennial-scale climate oscillations can extend beyond the North Atlantic and influence climate of the Great Basin. The magnetic mineralogy of zones IV-VII (MIS 5, 6, and 7) indicates varying degrees of post-depositional alteration between cold and warm substages, with greigite forming in fresher conditions and pyrite in the more saline conditions.

Identifying human-caused landscape change is challenging, however, and requires combining high-resolution physical proxies with detailed historical records from the same locality. In this study we demonstrate that paleoenvironmental change is the complex result of both human activity and climatic variation. We use pollen and geochemical analyses from lake sediments in central Italy along with archival records to analyze landscape change for the last 1400. years, including the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and the Little Ice Age (LIA). Between 870 and 925 AD deforestation coincided with intensification of agriculture associated with development of monastic estates that exploited increasingly larger land holdings as well as new settlement patterns in higher-elevation defensible locations (incastellamento). Above average temperatures probably allowed high elevation settlements to persist throughout the MCA, though social trends played a large role in the conversion of uplands into an agro-pastoral landscape. Cool temperatures and increased precipitation at the beginning of the LIA, 1400 AD, combined with population loss to plague of >50 percent overwhelmed the technical capabilities of the population leading to abandonment of high elevation settlements and persistent flooding of the valley. The landscape rapidly reforested and the plain reverted to wetland. In 1601, during one of the coldest periods of the LIA, new hydrologic technology allowed the community to drain the wetlands and successfully mitigate the impacts of climate change. Despite increased LIA precipitation, the basin was steadily reclaimed and converted to agriculture by 1750 AD." ;

Pollen and chironomid temperature and precipitation transfer-function estimates for the Allerd warming period indicate colder winters, precipitation levels half that of modern times, and summer temperatures near modern levels. The combination of cold winters and low precipitation prevented forest establishment in northern Maine along the Maine/New Brunswick border. While winter temperatures and precipitation remained stable, summer temperatures decreased as much as 7.5 C during the Younger Dryas stadial, forcing a shift from shrub-dominated to sedge-dominated tundra.

Seismic reflection profiles confirm the origin of the lake as a result of regional tilting and provide an estimated age of 400 000 years for the lake basin. Three major desiccation events are recorded in the seismic records that may reflect the 100 000 year Milankovitch cycle of climate forcing. The most recent arid period resulted in complete desiccation of the pre-existing lake. Lake Victoria arose from a dry landscape 14 600 calendar years ago (14.6 ka). Primary production was extremely high as lake level rose in its first 500 years, nourished by the high input of nutrients from the flooded landscape. A few species of cichlids and other fish swam out of their fluvial refugia to colonize the new lake, generating hundreds of new endemic species over the ensuing 14 000 years. Lake level rose until a brief overflow event at about 14.2 ka to 13.6 ka. Closed-basin conditions returned during the Younger Dryas until 11.2 ka, when major outflow and open-basin conditions were permanently established. The lake experienced progressively stronger stratification and water-column stability through the first half of the Holocene, and diatom productivity dropped to a minimum from 9.8 to about 7.5 ka. This period coincides with, but is much longer than, the 8.2 ka climatic event that has been observed in many Holocene records from throughout the world. The degree of water-column mixing appears to have steadily increased over the last 6000 years. Short cores from the open lake, document a shift in lake conditions beginning in the 1930s that progressed to the major ecosystem collapse of the early 1980s. The coincidence of the shift in sediment properties in the 1930s with the beginning of rapid expansion of human population and agricultural activity suggests cause and effect. It is conceivable that the lake experienced similar conditions due to natural causes between about 9800 and 7500 years ago." ;

Peaks in both the relative abundance and total production of Podocarpus pollen define the first two of these drought episodes. From 135 to 127 and again from 117 to 105 kyr BP, Podocarpus percentages remain above 16% with peak values as high as 38% indicating a period marked by a cool climate resulting in expansion of montane forest taxa to lower elevations. Marine palynological records from the Angola Margin and Congo Fan show similar peak Podocarpus percentages at this time (oxygen isotope stage 5d) indicating a similar climate across the African continent at this latitude. From 105 to 90 ka, continuing drought resulted in total pollen accumulation rates in Lake Malawi to fall to less than 300 grains/cm2/yr of predominately grass pollen. This episode in African history was severe enough to cause the disappearance of pteridophytes and forest taxa such as Uapaca and Brachystegia as well as montane taxa (Podocarpus, Olea spp. and Ericaceae) within the pollen source area of Lake Malawi. These taxa all remain nearly absent from the surrounding vegetation for the next 18,000 years. The resultant semi-desert vegetation would have been inhospitable for early humans living within or traveling through the Lake Malawi region. Increasing moisture following these arid intervals allowed expansion, creation and maintenance of a more diverse landscape vegetation mosaic around Lake Malawi including Zambezian miombo woodland, humid evergreen woodland and afromontane forests. The relative abundance of each fluctuated in response to either cooling (i.e. afromontane expansion from 60 to 56 ka) or moisture balance (i.e. increasing humid evergreen woodland between 75 and 65 ka). Notably there was no significant change in vegetation composition during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (30-15 ka) as compared to the previous 20,000 years." ;

Three rivers contribute sediment to Lake Pepin, and each catchment is characterized by a distinctly different geologic terrain. The geochemical fingerprint for each drainage basin was determined from the elemental composition of heavy minerals in the silt-sized fraction of modern sediment samples. Down-core elemental abundances were compared with these fingerprints by use of a chemical-mass-balance model that apportions sediment to the source areas. We observed a decreased contribution from the Minnesota River during the interval 6700-5500 14C yr BP, which we attribute to decreased discharge of the Minnesota River, likely controlled by a combination of precipitation, snow melt, and groundwater input to the river. This hydrologic condition coincides with the mid-Holocene prairie period recorded by fossil pollen data. The occurrence of this feature in a proxy record for hydrologic variations supports the hypothesis that the mid-Holocene prairie period reflects drier conditions than before or after in midwestern North America.

Sediment records from three crater lakes indicate that the most severe drought of the last 1200 years struck East Java at the end of the LIA. We use 14C and U-series dating applied to carbonate geochemical records from Lakes Lading, Logung, and Lamongan to demonstrate this drought occurred at 1790 Common Era (CE)  20 years. Drought occurred during a period of strong El Nino events and Asian monsoon failures in the late 1790s, yet our records indicate that drought conditions persisted well beyond this decade and reached peak intensity in East Java ca 1810 CE  30 years. The continuation of severe drought into the 1800s may have resulted from the large volcanic eruptions that occurred in 1809, 1815 and 1835 CE, which likely caused brief, abrupt decreases in Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) sea surface temperatures (SSTs), reducing local convection in East Java. Alternatively, broad changes in atmospheric circulation, such as a slowing of the Pacific Walker Circulation in response to decreased solar radiation during the LIA, could have produced several decades of drought in East Java. However, there is a lack of clear supporting evidence for such a change based upon paleohydrological records from the opposite ends of both the Indian and Pacific ocean zonal circulation systems. Based on the available evidence, we suggest severe multidecadal drought in East Java throughout the turn of the 19th century was driven by locally reduced convection resulting from a combination of heightened El Nino activity and volcanic eruptions." ;

Many social scientists, including anthropologists and environmental historians, reject environmental explanations as deterministic and overly simplistic. they argue that socio-political decisions contribute to environmental change and that efforts to study societal vulnerability within a human-environment system must include analysis of complex social structures. there is a gap in our understanding of how past societies responded to climate change because there are very few interdisciplinary studies that integrate both physical and behavioral sciences in paleoenvironmental reconstructions. While there is a general sense that modern societies are more insulated than pre-industrial societies from the effects of climate change, this may not prove to be true. a more complete understanding of how both natural and human-caused changes have affected the environment in the past can potentially guide decisions aimed at promoting future sustainability. here we present a project funded by the United States National science foundation that will explicitly integrate paleoenvironmental reconstruction with socioeconomic history in a local context to identify linkages between social and environmental change associated with climate variability." ;

This method corrects for intertaxonomic differences in pollen productivity and neutralizes influences of background pollen on pollen representation of vegetation, using an inverse form of the Extended R-value model. We test the method using modern pollen-vegetation data from small hollows in northern Michigan (6 taxa; 45 sites) and from northwestern Wisconsin (7 taxa; 43 sites) in the USA. Compared with pollen percentages, the one-tailed Fisher Exact test shows that the QAD method significantly improves the accuracy of the results for all taxa. The rank order of sites based on QAD is significantly correlated to the rank order of sites based on a survey of vegetation composition surrounding the hollow for each taxon (Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficients; p<0.001). We apply QAD to 9000-yr pollen records from two forest hollows c. 6 km apart in northern Michigan. Among seven taxa compared, Pinus, a taxon with well-dispersed pollen and a high pollen producer, often displays discrepancies in the direction of difference between QAD and the percentage-based method, demonstrating that pollen percentages alone do not always reflect differences in vegetation composition accurately. When several similarly sized sites are available in the same vegetation zone, QAD can objectively rank-order sites for individual taxa in relation to, for example, differences in soils, topography, patterns of species invasion, natural and anthropogenic disturbances, and other factors." ;

Wet and arid phases in southeast Africa were in phase with conditions in the global tropics from 23 to 11 ka, but at the start of the Holocene these relationships ended and an antiphase relationship prevailed. The abrupt switch from in phase to out of phase conditions may partially be attributed to a southward displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during the last glacial. Southward displacements of the ITCZ are also linked to arid conditions in southeast Africa during the Younger Dryas and the Little Ice Age.  2007 The Geological Society of America." ;

To evaluate the historical exposure of waters to these compounds, the levels of triclosan, CTDs, and their derived dioxins were determined in sediment cores collected from wastewater-impacted Minnesota lakes. The accumulation rates and temporal trends of triclosan, CTDs, and dioxins in aquatic sediments were found to be a function of historical wastewater treatment operations and lake system scale. Cores collected from large-scale riverine systems with many wastewater sources recorded increasing concentrations of triclosan, CTDs, and their derived dioxins since the patent of triclosan in 1964. In small-scale lakes with a single wastewater source, the trends were directly attributed to increased triclosan use, local improvements in treatment, and changes in wastewater disinfection since the 1960s. In the lake with no wastewater input, no triclosan or CTDs were detected. Overall, concentrations of triclosan, CTDs, and their dioxins were higher in small-scale systems, reflecting a greater degree of wastewater impact. In cores collected in northern MN, the four dioxins derived from triclosan are present prior to the patent of triclosan, suggesting a secondary source. It is clear, however, that triclosan and CTDs are the dominant source of these congeners after 1965 in systems impacted by wastewater." ;

Patch dynamics and forest disturbance have seldom been considered as drivers that can amplify or dampen rates of peat accumulation. Here we used a modified piston corer, noninvasive geophysical measurements, and geochemical and paleobotanical techniques to establish the effect of tree fall on carbon accumulation rates in a peat swamp forest dominated by Shorea albida in Brunei (Borneo). Carbon initially accumulated in a mangrove forest at over 300 g C m2 yr1 but declined to less than 50 g C m2 yr1 with the establishment of a peat swamp forest. A rapid accumulation pulse of 720960 g C m2 yr1 occurred around 1080 years ago as a tip-up pool infilled. Tip-up pools are common in the peatlands of northwest Borneo where windthrow and lightning strikes produce tree falls at a rate of 4 trees ha1 every decade. A simulation model indicates that tip-up pools, which are formed across the entire forested peat dome, produce local discontinuities in the peat deposit, when peat is removed to create a pool that is rapidly filled with younger material. The resulting discontinuities in peat age at the base and sides of pool deposits obscure linkages between carbon accumulation rates and climate and require new approaches for paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Our results suggest that carbon accumulation in tropical peat swamps may be based on fundamentally different peat-forming processes than those of northern peatlands." ;

LIS retreat from Superior opened eastern Lake Agassiz outlets so that the rhythmites reflect the combined impacts of sediment-laden meltwater and Lake Agassiz discharge. Multiple rhythmite stratigraphies, a time series analysis of the thickness measurements, and high-resolution inorganic carbonate data demonstrate that this is an annual record (varved). The varve thickness records primarily document regional ice margin dynamics; correlative thick varve sequences at 9100 cal ybp [similar to 8.1 C-14 ka] and 10,400-10,200 cal ybp [similar to 9.2-9.0 C-14 ka] record two periods of enhanced glaciofluvial discharge, most likely moraine formation (the Nakina and Nipigon). General varve cessation is associated with the circumvention of Lake Agassiz and glacial meltwater into Lake Ojibway at 9040 cal ybp [similar to 8.1 C-14 ka], although adjacent to the inlets from Lake Nipigon, rhythmic sedimentation persisted for 200 years. Positively identifying Lake Agassiz catastrophic discharge events remains speculative but seems feasible. Following retreat of Marquette ice that had re-advanced to fill the basin, the initial influx of Lake Agassiz water is expected at around 10,600 cal ybp [similar to 9.4 C-14 kal, but at this time, most of northeastern Lake Superior was covered by ice. Three sets of thick-thin varves in western Lake Superior perhaps record influxes of Lake Agassiz at around 10,630, 10,600, and 10,570 ca] ybp [similar to 9.4 C-14 ka]. Varve formation in Superior coincides with high lake levels in Lake Huron, suggesting that high lake levels in Huron correspond to periods of high Agassiz and/or meltwater flow into Lake Superior.

Variations in oxygen and carbon isotopes closely follow lithologic variations, which consist of alternating gypsum and clay deposits that were deposited under relatively dry and wet climate, respectively. During the last glacial period, the greatest 18O and 13C values coincide with gypsum deposited during lake lowstands under arid climate conditions that were correlated previously with North Atlantic Heinrich events. In contrast, interstadials and the entirety of the Last Glacial Maximum (2419 cal ka BP) are marked by clay deposition and lower 18O and 13C values, reflecting higher lake levels and relatively moister climate. Isotope results and pollen data, along with independently inferred past water levels, show the early deglacial period (1915 cal ka BP) was the time of greatest aridity and lowest lake stage of the past 43 ka. This period occurred during Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS 1), when an extensive tropical megadrought has been postulated (Stager et al., 2011). Heinrich Stadial 1 is represented by two episodes of gypsum precipitation and high 18O and 13C values in Peten Itza, interrupted by an intervening period of lower 18O and 13C and clay deposition centered on 17 cal ka BP. The two periods of inferred maximum cold and/or arid conditions at 17.5 and 16.1 cal ka BP coincide approximately with two pulses of ice-rafted debris (IRD) recorded off southern Portugal (Bard et al., 2000). At 15 cal ka BP, coinciding with the start of the Bolling-Allerod period, 18O and 13C decrease and gypsum precipitation ceases, indicating a transition to warmer and/or wetter conditions. Gypsum precipitation resumed while 18O and 13C increased at the start of the Younger Dryas at 13.1 cal ka BP and continued until 10.4 cal ka BP, near the onset of the Holocene. Precipitation changes during the last glacial period in the northern hemisphere Neotropics were closely linked with freshwater forcing to the high-latitude North Atlantic, and sensitive to changes in the location of meltwater input. Climate was coldest/driest when meltwater directly entered the high-latitude North Atlantic, permitting sea ice expansion and weakening of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), which resulted in a more southerly position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Upon deglaciation, when meltwater was directed to the Gulf of Mexico, at 17 ka and during the Bolling-Allerod period (1513 ka), precipitation increased in the northern hemisphere Neotropics as North Atlantic sea ice retreated and the ITCZ shifted northward. Results from Lake Peten Itza offer some support for the meltwater routing hypothesis of Clark et al. (2001)." ;

In comparison to eastern Beringia (nonglaciated Yukon and Alaska), few Plio-Pleistocene distal tephra are known from western Beringia (non-glaciated arctic and subarctic eastern Russia), hindering the dating and correlation of sediments beyond the limit of radiocarbon and luminescence methods. The identification of eight visible tephra layers (T0-T7) in sediment cores extracted from Lake El'gygytgyn, in the Far East Russian Arctic, indicates the feasibility of developing a tephrostratigraphic framework for this region. These tephra range in age from ca 45 ky to 2.2My old, and each is described and characterized by its major-, minor-, trace-element and Pb isotope composition. These data show that subduction-zone-related volcanism from the Kurile-Kamchatka-Aleutian Arc and Alaska Peninsula is the most likely source, with Pb isotope data indicating a Kamchatkan volcanic source for tephra layers T0-T5 and T7, while a source in the Aleutian Arc is possible for tephra T6. The location of Lake El'gygytgyn relative to potential source volcanoes (>1000 km) suggests these tephra are regionally distributed over a large area. These deposits provide a unique opportunity to correlate the highresolution paleoenvironmental records of Lake El'gygytgyn to other terrestrial paleoenvironmental archives from western Beringia and marine records from the western North Pacific and Bering Sea, and to move towards the development of a robust integrated framework between the continuous paleoclimatic records of Lake El'gygytgyn and other terrestrial and marine records in NE Eurasia.

However, most of these records are compromised by chronological flaws, making problematic any comparisons with climatic interpretations based on other records (e.g., GISP2 in Greenland). We report here a high-resolution pollen record with a secure chronology constrained by 26 14C dates on terrestrial macrofossils from Steel Lake, central Minnesota. About 11.2ka cal BP (11,000 calibrated yr before present) the late-glacial Picea forest near Steel Lake was succeeded abruptly by Pinus banksiana and/or resinosa. The Pinus forest began to open 9.4ka cal BP with the expansion of prairie taxa, and a pine parkland or savanna prevailed until about 8ka cal BP, when Quercus replaced Pinus to become the dominant tree in the prairie areas for 4500 yr. The close chronological control permits the correlation of key vegetational changes with those at other reliably dated sites in the eastern Dakotas and in Minnesota, suggesting that the abrupt decline of the spruce forest was time-transgressive from southwest to northeast during 2000 yr, and that the development of prairie was time-transgressive in the same direction over 2600 yr. Correlation of key pollen horizons at Steel Lake with those in the high-resolution pollen profiles of Elk Lake, ca. 50km northwest of Steel Lake, suggests that the well-known Elk Lake varve chronology for the early Holocene is about 1000 yr too young.  2003 Elsevier Ltd.

These genera include Limnocythere, Candonopsis, Ilyocypris, Sclerocypris, Gomphocythere, possible Allocypria? and an unknown Cypridosine. Taphonomic variables such as the percentage of valve breakage, adult individuals, carbonate and oxidized coatings as well as associated mineralogy, can be used to delineate lake-level low and highstands. This record of lake-level fluctuations is correlated with paleoecological changes in ostracod communities throughout the core record of the past ~ 145 ka. Two major assemblages found within the Lake Malawi cores include a Limnocythere-dominated shallow, saline/alkaline assemblage that occurred between 133 and 130 ka and between 118 and 90 ka and a deeper water Cypridopsine assemblage that lived in waters 10s to 100s of meters in depth and dominated the ostracod assemblage during intervals of lake-level transitions (136-133 ka, 129-128 ka and 86-63 ka), between the occurrence of the littoral assemblage and the appearance of indicators of bottom water anoxia. Changes in occurrences and abundances indicate variations in paleoecological affinities related to lake chemistry and oxygenation of bottom waters. The characteristics of the different lineages influence how that lineage is likely to respond to environmental variability such as lake-level fluctuations. Clades that include large numbers of endemic species in Lake Malawi tend to be specialists and thus more susceptible to environmental perturbations. On the other hand, cosmopolitan species within the lake all appear to be generalists, suggesting that they have high tolerances to environmental variability and therefore, these genera tend to be monospecific within the lake and are less likely to have radiated within the basin. The distribution of these ostracods can be used to evaluate hypotheses about the environmental history at the landscape-scale and their potential influence on species' distribution and diversification histories." ;

Cyclic variations in the chemical composition of basalts from 1136 m of scientific drill core show that the parent magmas of these lavas evolved by crystal fractionation at shallow to intermediate crustal depths, punctuated by episodic recharge with more primitive compositions and assimilation of adjacent wall rock. We have identified 10 upward fractionation cycles and four reversed cycles; assimilation of sialic crust was limited and mainly affects the oldest basalts, which directly overlie rhyolites. We infer that the crystal fractionation and/or recharge cycles took place in a series of sill-like intrusions at intermediate crustal depths that now form a layered mafic intrusion that underlies the eastern Snake River Plain at depth. This layered sill complex is represented by the 10-km-thick basaltic sill that has been imaged seismically at 1222 km depth. The association of this mid-crustal sill complex with geochemical fractionation cycles in basalt supports the concept that exposed layered mafic intrusions may be linked to overlying basalt provinces that have since been removed by erosion." ;

The high-resolution analyses attained in this study allowed to distinguish abrupt periods, identify the complex structures of the early and mid-Holocene arid intervals and to compare their timing with Titicaca lake and Sajama ice records. Three main components in the lake sediments have been identified: (a) biogenic component, mainly from diatoms (b) volcanics (ash layers) from the nearby Parinacota Volcano and (c) endogenic carbonates. The correlation between volcanic input in Lago Chungara and the total particles deposited in the Nevado Sajama ice core suggests the Parinacota Volcano as the common source. The geochemical record of Lago Chungara indicates an increase in siliceous productivity during the early Holocene, lagging behind the rise in temperatures inferred from the Nevado Sajama ice core. The regional mid-Holocene aridity crisis can be characterized as a number of short events with calcite and aragonite precipitation in the offshore lake zones.  2006 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA." ;

A multiproxy analysis provided comprehensive information about regional humidity and temperature changes. The analysis included sedimentological descriptions, physical properties, organic carbon and carbonate content, mineralogy and geochemical composition together with biological proxies including diatom and ostracod assemblages. A detailed pollen study enabled reconstruction of variations in vegetation cover, which were interpreted in the context of climate changes and human impact. Four distinct stages were recognized for the last 13,500 years: (1) a cold and dry episode that includes the Younger Dryas event (13,50011,600 cal. year BP); (2) a humid and warmer period characterizing the onset of the Holocene (11,6008,700 cal. year BP); (3) a tendency toward a drier climate during the middle Holocene (8,7004,650 cal. year BP); and (4) a return to humid conditions following landscape modification by human activity (pastoral activities, deforestation) in the late Holocene (4,6502,200 cal. year BP). Superimposed on relatively stable landscape conditions (e.g. maintenance of well established forests), the typical environmental variability of the southern European region is observed at this site." ;

All of the lakes have risen since 9.0 ka, but multicentury droughts after 5.6 ka repeatedly lowered their water levels. Quantified water level histories from the three best-studied lakes share 70% of their reconstructed variance. Four prominent low-water phases at 4.9-4.6, 4.2-3.9, 2.9-2.1, and 1.3-1.2 ka were synchronous across coastal lakes, even after accounting for age uncertainties. The droughts also affected sites up to 200 km inland, but water level changes at 5.6-4.9 ka appear out of phase between inland and coastal lakes. During the enhanced multicentury variability after 5.6 ka, droughts coincided with cooling in Greenland and may indicate circulation changes across the North Atlantic region. Overall, the records demonstrate that current water levels are exceptionally high and confirm the sensitivity of water resources in the northeast U.S. to climate change." ;

Relatively little is known about the long-term climate history of the area or the relative impact of changes in climate and land use in the region. Tree-ring records have established an understanding of regional temperature fluctuations; however, the few records of moisture balance from Mongolia offer little insight into potential changes in the precipitation-to-evaporation balance in the region with warming temperatures. Modern and paleoclimatic records from across arid Central Asia show substantial temporal and spatial variability in the correlation between temperature and moisture availability and climate models are inconsistent in predictions for future changes with continued warming. In order to refine the understanding of moisture balance in the region, we developed six diatom-inferred records of lake salinity between 200 and 2000 years in length, demonstrating a negative correlation between temperature and effective moisture (warm-dry and cool-wet conditions) over most of this time period. In addition to climate warming, Mongolian grasslands have seen substantial human impacts over the last several decades. Recent core records show evidence of eutrophication and must be interpreted carefully to understand the individual and combined impacts of climate and land use on sedimentary records and the potential for human-environment interactions to confound inferences about climate changes.

A high-resolution (near decadal) fossil diatom record from Kettle Lake, ND, USA that spans the last 8500 cal. yr BP is interpreted in concert with percent abundance of aragonite in the sediment as an independent proxy of groundwater flow to the lake (and thus lake water level). Kettle Lake has been relatively fresh for the majority of the Holocene, likely because of the coarse substrata and a strong connection to the underlying aquifer. Interpretation of diatom assemblages in four groups indicative of low to high groundwater flow, based on the percent of aragonite in sediments, allow interpretations of arid periods (and probable meromictic lake conditions) that could not be detected based on diatom-based salinity reconstructions alone. At the centennial-millennial scale, the diatom record suggests humid/wet periods from 8351 to 8088, 4364 to 1406 and 872 to 620 cal. yr BP, with more arid periods intervening. During the last ~ 4500 years, decadal-centennial scale periods of drought have taken place, despite the generally wetter climate. These droughts appear to have had similar impacts on the Kettle Lake hydrology as the 'Dust Bowl' era droughts, but were longer in duration.  SAGE Publications 2011." ;

Extant playa lakes provide vital habitat for numerous endemic species, whereas sediments from these deposystems may record signals of climate change or develop natural resources over geological time. Laguna de los Pozuelos (North-west Argentina) provides the opportunity for an actualistic sedimentological and geochemical assessment of a piggyback basin playa lake in an area of critical interest for understanding Quaternary palaeoclimate dynamics. Silty clays and diatom ooze are the dominant playa-lake centre microfacies, with concentrations of total organic carbon and biogenic silica commonly exceeding 15 wt% in this sub-environment. Elemental and stable isotopic analyses point to a mixed organic matter composition in the playa-lake centre, with substantial contributions from algae and transported aquatic macrophytes. Bulk sediment and organic mass accumulation rates in the southern playa-lake centre approach 022 g cm2 year1 and 289 mg cm2 year1, respectively, indicating moderately rapid deposition with negligible deflation over historic time. Playa margin facies contain higher percentages of fragmented biogenic carbonate (ostracods and charophytes) and inorganically precipitated aragonite crusts due to seasonal pumping and evaporation of ground water. Organic matter accumulation is limited along these heavily bioturbated wet and dry mud flats. Fluviallacustrine transitional environments, which are key waterbird habitats, are either silty terminal splay (northern axis) or sandy deltas (southern axis) containing highly oxidized and partially allochthonous organic matter. Modern analogue data from Laguna de los Pozuelos provide key insights for: (i) environmental reconstructions of ancient lake sequences; and (ii) improving facies models for piggyback basins." ;

LRA first uses the REVEALS model to estimate regional vegetation using pollen data from large sites and then the LOVE model to estimate vegetation composition within the relevant source area of pollen (RSAP) at small sites by subtracting the background pollen estimated from the regional vegetation composition. This study tests LRA using training data from forest hollows in northern Michigan (35 sites) and northwestern Wisconsin (43 sites). In northern Michigan, surface pollen from 152-ha and 332-ha lakes is used for REVEALS. Because of the lack of pollen data from large lakes in northwestern Wisconsin, we use pollen from 21 hollows randomly selected from the 43 sites for REVEALS. RSAP indirectly estimated by LRA is comparable to the expected value in each region. A regression analysis and permutation test validate that the LRA-based vegetation reconstruction is significantly more accurate than pollen percentages alone in both regions. Even though the site selection in northwestern Wisconsin is not ideal, the results are robust. The LRA is a significant step forward in quantitative reconstruction of vegetation." ;

In this study we explored the spatial changes in lake water chemistry and biology along a gradient of dust deposition in the Wind River Range, Wyoming. Regional differences were explored using the variation in bulk deposition, lake water, sediment, and bedrock geochemistry and catchment characteristics. Dust deposition rates in the Southwestern region averaged 3.34 g m-2 year-1, approximately three times higher than deposition rates in the Northwestern region (average 1.06 g m-2 year-1). Dust-P deposition rates ranged from 87 g P m2 day-1 in the Northwestern region to 276 g P m2 day-1 in the Southwestern region. Subalpine and alpine lakes in the Southwestern region had greater total phosphorus (TP) concentrations (5-13 g L-1) and greater sediment phosphorus (SP) concentrations (2-5 mg g-1) than similar lakes elsewhere in the region (1-8 g L-1 TP, 0.5-2 mg g-1 SP). Lake phosphorus concentrations were related to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) across vegetation gradients, but related to the percent of bare rock, catchment area to lake area, and catchment steepness across dust deposition gradients. Modern phytoplankton and zooplankton biomasses were two orders of magnitude greater in the Southwest than in the Northwest, and alpine lakes in the Southwest had a unique diatom species assemblage with relatively higher concentrations of Asterionella formosa, Pseudostaurosira pseudoconstruens, and Pseudostaurosira brevistriata. These results suggests that catchment controls on P export to lakes (i.e. DOC) are overridden in dominantly bare rock basins where poor soils cannot effectively retain dust deposited P.  2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland." ;

Terrestrial sites there offer the potential for well-dated, high-resolution, continuous records of environmental change and/or glacier activity. Laminated sediments from the proglacial lake Hvitarvatn provide a continuous record of environmental change and the development of the adjacent Langjokull ice cap for the past 10.2 ka. Replicate lake sediment cores, collected from multiple locations in the basin, are placed in a secure geochronology by splicing a varve chronology for the past 3 ka with a tephra-constrained, paleomagnetic secular variation derived chronology for older sediments. Multiple proxies, including sedimentation rate, bulk density, ice-rafted debris, sediment organic matter, biogenic silica, and diatom abundance, allow annual to multi-decadal resolution and reveal a dynamic Holocene terrestrial climate. Following regional deglaciation of the main Iceland Ice Sheet, summer temperatures were high enough that mountain ice caps had already melted, or were contributing insignificant sediment to the lake. Pronounced increases in sedimentation rate, sediment density, and the influx of terrestrial organic matter, between 8.7 and 7.9 ka suggest early Holocene warmth was interrupted by two distinct pulses of cold summers leading to widespread landscape destabilization and possibly glacier growth. The Holocene thermal maximum (HTM; 7.9 to 5.5 ka) was characterized by high within-lake productivity and ice-free conditions in the watershed. Neoglaciation is recorded as a non-linear transition toward cooler summers, landscape destabilization, and the inception and expansion of Langjokull beginning ca 5.5 ka, with notable increases in ice cap size and landscape instability at 4.2 and 3.0 ka. The past two millennia are characterized by the abrupt onset of sustained cold periods at ca 550 and 1250 AD, separated by an interval of relative warmth from ca 950 to 1150 AD. The greatest Holocene extent of Langjokull occurred in the nineteenth century and is coincident with peak landscape instability, followed by ice recession throughout the twentieth century." ;

Our findings document one and possibly three periods of significantly reduced inflow to the Nile River system from the White Nile. Based on sediment fabric and mineralogy, shifts in percentages of total organic carbon (TOC) and total organic nitrogen (TON), hydrogen index (HI), and 13C and 15N, as well as poor preservation of sporopollenin and siliceous microfossils, we recognize two mature paleosols that formed between 18,000 and 12,500 14C yr BP at the surface of exposed lacustrine muds. A thin fossiliferous zone between the two soils documents a brief period of flooding Lake Albert was below the level of the coring site, and thus a closed basin, for several thousand years during the late Pleistocene. Around 12,500 14C yr BP the younger vertisol was flooded by a major rise in lake level. Relatively deep-water conditions were established soon after this transgression, but an apparent change in sedimentation rate sometime between 8,000 and 3,400 14C yr BP may reflect another, briefer period of low water, which resulted in interruption of sedimentation at the coring site. Palynological data document a rapid and abrupt shift to drier conditions around Lake Albert from 11,400 to 9,900 14C yr BP coincident with the cool Younger Dryas event of the Northern Hemisphere. Geochemical evidence suggests that throughout the terminal Pleistocene and early Holocene, and again in the late Holocene, the water column was relatively well-mixed with little tendency to persistent anoxia." ;

The orbitally-tuned age model allows the diatom assemblages to be compared with individual marine isotopic stages and substages during the Brunhes. Most of the interglacial periods are characterized by explosive speciation and appearances of new pelagic planktonic diatom species. In contrast, most of the glacial periods are characterized by spectacular extinctions. Three broad periods characterized by different degrees of stability in the pelagic diatom assemblages are distinguished during the Brunhes chron in the Lake Baikal sedimentary record: MIS 19-15e, MIS 15a-11 and MIS 9-5, these periods are apparently associated with the long-term changes in the amplitude of precessional insolation variations. Examination of individual interglacial periods further reveals the sensitivity of the Baikal ecosystem to the regional energy balance: virtually every precessional insolation peak during the early Brunhes is characterized by a unique and peculiar paleo-assemblage. For the first time the siliceous microfossil record has demonstrated such a high degree of sensitivity to insolation forcing of regional climate. Despite the dramatic changes in the pelagic plankton driven by extreme climatic changes, diatoms never went fully extinct during any glacial period. Although greatly or completely renewed during each subsequent interglacial, the pelagic diatom assemblage still managed to return dominated by the new Baikal endemic species. The diatom assemblage observed in modern Lake Baikal, despite being mostly endemic, has formed during the past 50-100 ka and is therefore rather young. These results demonstrate the remarkable capacity of this large freshwater system to sustain the dynamic stability on the large time scales.  2001 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA.

Property damage from this flooding led to an examination of the occurrence of past pluvial episodes and their relation to climate. A 1000- year hydroclimate reconstruction was developed from local bur oak ( Quercus macrocarpa) tree- ring records and lake- sediment cores. Analysis of lake shoreline and drainage features provides late- Quaternary geomorphic context for this high- resolution record. Tree- ring width and shell geochemistry of the ostracode Candona rawsoni show marked coherence, indicating synchronous responses to moisture balance in vegetation and lake salinity; geomorphic evidence suggests buffering of lake- system expansion during pluvial periods by evaporative dynamics. Pluvial periods display a recurrence frequency of approximately 140 - 160 years over the past millennium. Prior to AD 1800, both lake highstands and droughts tended towards greater persistence than during the past two centuries. Frequency and timing of hydroclimatic oscillations show strong similarities to records from other sites in the Northern Great Plains ( NGP) of North and South Dakota, and incomplete coherence with records of southern Manitoba." ;

Participants submitted 3-page \"pre-proposals\" to highlight projects that envisioned using drill-core studies to address scientific issues in paleobiology, paleoclimatology, stratigraphy and biogeochemistry, and to identify locations where key questions can best be addressed. The workshop was also intended to encourage US scientists to take advantage of the exceptional capacity of unweathered, continuous core records to answer important questions in the history of earth's sedimentary, biogeochemical and paleobiologic systems. Introductory talks on drilling and coring methods, plus best practices in core handling and curation, opened the workshop to enable all to understand the opportunities and challenges presented by scientific drilling. Participants worked in thematic breakout sessions to consider questions to be addressed using drill cores related to glacial-interglacial and icehouse-greenhouse transitions, records of evolutionary events and extinctions, records of major biogeochemical events in the oceans, reorganization of earth's atmosphere, Lagerstatte and exceptional fossil biota, records of vegetation-landscape change, and special sampling requirements, contamination, and coring tool concerns for paleobiology, geochemistry, geochronology, and stratigraphy-sedimentology studies. Closing discussions at the workshop focused on the role drilling can play in studying overarching science questions about the evolution of the earth system. The key theme, holding the most impact in terms of societal relevance, is understanding how climate transitions have driven biotic change, and the role of pristine, stratigraphically continuous cores in advancing our understanding of this linkage. Scientific drilling, and particularly drilling applied to continental targets, provides unique opportunities to obtain continuous and unaltered material for increasingly sophisticated analyses, tapping the entire geologic record (extending through the Archean), and probing the full dynamic range of climate change and its impact on biotic history.

Assessing the effects of Euro-American settlement is difficult because climate changes occur on multi-decadal to centennial time scales and require longer time perspectives than historic observations can provide. Here, we report vegetation and environmental changes over the past ~13,000 years as recorded in a sediment record from Bison Lake, a subalpine lake on a high plateau in northwestern Colorado. Results are based on multiple independent proxies, which include pollen, charcoal, and elemental geochemistry, and are compared with previously reported interpretations of hydroclimatic changes from oxygen isotope ratios. The pollen data indicate a slowly changing vegetation sequence from sagebrush steppe during the late glacial to coniferous forest through the late Holocene. The most dramatic vegetation changes of the Holocene occurred during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and Little Ice Age (LIA) with rapid replacement of conifer forest by grassland followed by an equally rapid return to conifer forest. Late Holocene vegetation responses are mirrored by changes in fire, lake biological productivity, and watershed erosion. These combined records indicate that subsequent disturbance related to Euro-American settlement, although perhaps significant, had acted upon a landscape that was already responding to MCA-LIA hydroclimatic change. Results document both rapid and long-term subalpine grassland ecosystem dynamics driven by agents of change that can be anticipated in the future and simulated by ecosystem models." ;

A team of scientists and engineers met at Mountain Home Air Force Base in early 2011 near Boise, Idaho, to discuss the possibility of exploring for geothermal resources under the base. The team identified that there was a reasonable potential for geothermal resources based on data from an existing well. In addition, a regional gravity map helped identify several possible locations for drilling a new well. The team identified several possible sources of funding for this wellthe most logical being to use U.S. Department of Energy funds to drill the upper half of the well and U.S. Air Force funds to drill the bottom half of the well. The well was designed as a slimhole well in accordance with State of Idaho Department of Water Resources rules and regulations. Drilling operations commenced at the Mountain Home site in July of 2011 and were completed in January of 2012. Temperatures increased gradually, especially below a depth of 2000 ft. Temperatures increased more rapidly below a depth of 5500 ft. The bottom of the well is at 5976 ft, where a temperature of about 140C was recorded. The well flowed artesian from a depth below 5600 ft, until it was plugged off with drilling mud. Core samples were collected from the well and are being analyzed to help understand permeability at depth. Additional tests using a televiewer system will be run to evaluate orientation and directions at fractures, especially in the production zone. A final report on the well exploitation will be forthcoming later this year. The Air Force will use it to evaluate the geothermal resource potential for future private development options at Mountain Home Air Force Base. In conclusion, Recommendation for follow-up efforts include the following:" ;

Integration of high-resolution seismic reflection data, 14C dated sediment cores, and lake-floor bathymetry reveals large axial and transverse turbidite systems in the eastern basin of the lake. The turbidites were sourced by hyperpycnal river flows during exceptional floods, and the temporal occurrence of the turbidites was climatically controlled. The turbidite record over the past 12 k.y. is correlated with the regional paleohydrologic records from tropical East Africa. Our study suggests that flood-introduced turbidites preserved in deep lakes are indicators of hydrological changes, and that extreme floods in Lake Kivu's recent history may have triggered deep mixing events. This study also has implications for the current degassing efforts in Lake Kivu; potential geologic hazards may be triggered by extraordinary turbidity currents, and need to be considered in the design and deployment of gas extraction facilities." ;

Carbonate is second in abundance after the detrital silicate fraction of the sediments in the lake. It consists of ostracod tests and a silt-sized micrite. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the micrite to be euhedral crystals of low-Mg calcite about 10 microns in length. Carbon isotope values of the micrite indicate that it forms in the upper water column rather than in the sediments after burial. The oxygen isotope analyses indicate that the micrite could be at isotopic equilibrium with the modern lake waters at temperatures of 36C. This suggests that the micrite forms either in the surface waters of the open lake or in isolated shallow bays, and is then transported to the deep lake.  1989 Pergamon Press plc." ;

Based on the assumptions that phytC is of photosynthetic origin and a closed system, claims were recently made that phytoliths from several agriculturally important monocotyledonous species play a significant role in atmospheric CO2 sequestration. However, anomalous phytC radiocarbon (14C) dates suggested contributions from a non-photosynthetic source to phytC. Here we address this non-photosynthetic source hypothesis using comparative isotopic measurements (14C and  13C) of phytC, plant tissues, atmospheric CO2, and soil organic matter. State-of-the-art methods assured phytolith purity, while sequential stepwise-combustion revealed complex chemical-thermal decomposability properties of phytC. Although photosynthesis is the main source of carbon in plant tissue, it was found that phytC is partially derived from soil carbon that can be several thousand years old. The fact that phytC is not uniquely constituted of photosynthetic C limits the usefulness of phytC either as a dating tool or as a significant sink of atmospheric CO2. It additionally calls for further experiments to investigate how SOM-derived C is accessible to roots and accumulates in plant biosilica, for a better understanding of the mechanistic processes underlying the silicon biomineralization process in higher plants." ;

ns3:c0bcd182\-98f4\-3acc\-a68f\-2644a4abcb6e	ns2:abstracttext	"To date, terrestrial archives of long-term climatic change within the Arctic have widely been restricted to ice cores from Greenland and, more recently, sediments from Lake El'gygytgyn in northeast Arctic Russia. Sediments from this lake contain a paleoclimate record of glacialinterglacial cycles during the last three million years. Lowresolution studies at this lake have suggested that changes observed during Transition IV (the transition from marine isotope stage (MIS) 10 to MIS 9) are of greater amplitude than any observed since. In this study, geochemical parameters are used to infer past climatic conditions thus providing the first high-resolution analyses of Transition IV from a terrestrial Arctic setting. These results demonstrate that a significant shift in climate was subsequently followed by a rapid increase in biogenic silica (BSi) production. Following this sharp increase, bioproductivity remained high, but variable, for over a thousand years. This study reveals differences in the timing and magnitude of change within the ratio of silica to titanium (Si/Ti) and BSi records that would not be apparent in lower resolution studies. This has significant implications for the increasingly common use of Si/Ti data as an alternative to traditional BSi measurements.  Author(s) 2013." ;

We develop a stratigraphic framework of this basin over the last ~ 150 ka by integrating several vintages of seismic-reflection data with recently acquired drill cores. In the seismic-reflection data set, we document three lake-level cycles where progradational delta seismic facies and erosional truncation surfaces mark the basal boundary of each sequence. The clinoform packages and their down-dip, time-equivalent surfaces can be mapped throughout each basin, where each major lowstand surface was followed by a transgression and highstand. On several occasions, lake level dropped as much as 500 m below present lake level (BPLL) in the North Basin and 550 m BPLL in the Central Basin, resulting in a 97% reduction of water volume and 89% reduction of water surface area relative to modern conditions. Evidence for these lake-level fluctuations in the drill cores includes major changes in saturated bulk density, natural gamma ray values, and total organic carbon. During lowstands, density values doubled, while total organic carbon values dropped from ~ 5% to 0.2%. Coarse-grained sediment and organic matter flux into the basin were higher during transgressions, when precipitation, runoff, sediment supply, and nutrient input were high. This sedimentation pattern is also observed in seismic-reflection profiles, where coarse-grained seismic facies occur at the bases of sequences, and in the drill-core data where the highest total organic carbon values are observed immediately above lowstand surfaces." ;

Isotopic records are consistent with the following scenario: Before 9800 yr B.P. the two lakes were connected. Increasing evaporation through the jack/red pine period (9800-7700 yr B.P.) led to lower lake levels, leaving small separated basins. The prairie period (7700-4000 yr B.P.) reflects high aridity, and lake levels reached low stands shortly before 6500 yr B.P. Low lake levels are associated with groundwater discharge between 6500 and 6000 yr B.P. The hardwood period (4000-3200 yr B.P.) corresponds to long cold winters and warm to cool summers with lower evaporation rates and slower sedimentation. During the white pine period (<3200 yr B.P.) evaporation increased and/or precipitation shifted to the summer months. These changes can be related to shifting atmospheric circulation patterns. Zonal flow was probably dominant during the early Holocene until the end of the prairie period (c. 4000 yr B.P.). During the hardwood period a combination of zonal and meridional flow patterns caused long and cold winters and wetter summers. During the white pine period wintners were shorter and the meridional flow pattern more significant. Today meridional flow dominates the circulation pattern.  1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers." ;

In many cases, the tectonic and geomorphic history of these basins is under-constrained and poorly known, which affects the interpretation of climate history from geophysical, geochemical, and paleobiotic proxies in the sedimentary record. In addition, non-analog biotic assemblages that reflect evolutionary processes may constrain the reconstruction of past environments. In the drill-core record of Lake Titicaca, spanning the last ~. 370. ka, the diatom stratigraphy reflects both the influence of climate and the long-term evolution of the lake basin and its biota. In the upper part of the drill-core sequence, glacial intervals were deep and dominated by freshwater planktic taxa, and peak interglacial intervals were shallow and dominated by benthic species, some with saline affinities. In the basal sections of the drill-core record, benthic diatoms are dominant in both glacial and interglacial units, with freshwater taxa dominating the glacial strata. This suggests that the ancient lake basin was shallower during intervals of both wet and dry climate, and that the modern deep lake may result from a progressive subsidence and deepening of the basin over time. In addition, morphological evolution in one of the major lineages of planktic diatoms, Cyclostephanos, indicates substantial change in the limnological environment that affected species morphology and may have driven speciation.  2011 Elsevier B.V." ;

Ongoing management efforts to protect and restore the river hinge on the question of whether the increased nutrient load results from point-source discharges or nonpoint runoff from agricultural intensification and urban expansion. Here we determine the historical contribution of point source phosphorus (P) loads to the St. Croix watershed from 1900-2000 A.D. Historical point source loads were estimated based on discharge volumes, demographics, industrial sources, wastewater technologies, and facility discharge records, where available. Sewering in the basin began in 1905, and since that time, there have been as many as 169 permitted point source dischargers basinwide, including municipal, industrial, and agricultural facilities. Early wastewater management typically discharged untreated sewage; technological advances had secondary treatment in place at most facilities by the 1960s-1970s and much of the municipal population was served by tertiary treatment by the 1990s. Peak nutrient discharges from point sources occurred in the 1960s-1970s. Detergent phosphorus bans instituted in the late 1970s for Minnesota and Wisconsin, greater use of land and groundwater effluent disposal, and improvements in treatment technology brought about decreases in P loads in the 1980s and 1990s. Point-source discharges were compared to historical total phosphorus loads estimated in a whole-basin phosphorus mass balance to calculate the historical contribution of point sources, anthropogenic nonpoint sources, and natural or background sources. We estimated 1990s point source loads at 48 t P yr-1, which represents about 10% of the total phosphorus load (459 t P yr-1, flow-corrected to 412 t P yr-1) to the basin. Without further controls on nutrient inputs to the St. Croix River, annual flow-corrected P loads are projected to increase to 498 t P yr-1 by the 2020s with point source phosphorus loading contributions at 65 t P yr-1 or 13% of the total load. However, if we exclude background P loads to the St. Croix (166 t P yr -1), recent nutrient loads are primarily from anthropogenic nonpoint sources. Point sources also contribute over 19% of the current and future phosphorus load that can be attributed to human activities in the watershed. Interstate and federal efforts to decrease P loading to the St. Croix River by 20% will need to target both point and nonpoint sources.  2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

One has the chemical and physical properties of an extremely rich fen and the other has the properties of a raised bog. The mounds are separated by a water track with poor-fen vegetation and chemistry. The vegetation at Lost River can be divided into 5 noda that correspond to landform units:spring-fen channel; spring-fen forest, marginal swamp forest, water track, and raised bog. These vegetation types have well-defined ranges for pH and Ca concentration. Ordinations of vascular plant and bryophyte data indicate a close relationship between the vegetation and both moisture and chemical gradients. The link between vegetation and chemistry is also supported by plots of species richness vs pH and Ca concentration in which the peak in species numbers occurs within the rich-fen range. Amount of groundwater within the surface waters ranges from 50% in the spring-fen channels to 1% on the raised bog. The raised bog developed over a depression, which was first filled in with fen peat before minerotrophic sphagna invaded the site c2625 BP. BY 2200 BP all fen indicator species had disappeared and the site was dominated by assemblages similar to those in the present raised bog. The spring-fen mound, however, developed over a rise in the mineral substrate, which was not covered by peat until 3000 BP. The mound was quickly colonized by Sphagnum and no fen indicators appeared until 1160 BP. At this time the bog vegetation was replaced by a sedge fen containing assemblages similar to the present spring-fen channel. This sharp reversal from bog to fen under the spring-fen mound can best be explained by the discharge of alkaline groundwater at the peat surface in sufficient quantities to convert the bog vegetation to a spring-fen channel. -from Authors" ;

Transitions from drier to wetter conditions provide an opportunity to evaluate the system's response to climate shifts. Upon termination of drought episodes at 62 and 72 ka, enhanced precipitation and an associated increase in streampower led to enhanced physical erosion and landscapes were flooded by rising lake waters. These processes appear to have left their mark in the sedimentary record, bringing about a spike of deposition of organic matter (probably of terrestrial origin) at times of increased rainfall. This was immediately followed by a period of deposition of chemically-weathered material that had been retained on the landscape during arid times and mobilized in response to increased precipitation. After this altered material was removed (perhaps a thousand years after the transition to wetter conditions), fresher material, richer in soluble elements including nutrients, was exposed to chemical weathering, leading to substantial diatom blooms. The lag between the onset of wetter conditions and the diatom blooms is inconsistent with significant storage of bioavailable silica in soils in this system. However, biological cycling of silica, including formation and dissolution of phytoliths, may have played a role in mobilization of the silica necessary for the diatom productivity." ;

We used paleolimnological methods to estimate changes in carbon burial rates through time in a suite of natural lakes in the US state of Iowa which has watersheds that have been heavily modified over the last 150 years. Our results show increasing carbon burial for all lakes in our study as agriculture intensified. Our estimates of carbon burial rates, before land clearance, are similar to the published worldwide averages for nutrient-poor lakes. In nearly all the cases, burial rates increased to very high levels (up to 200 g C m -2 y -1) following agricultural development. These results support the idea that the increased autochthonous and allochthonous carbon flux, related to anthropogenic change, leads to higher rates of carbon burial. Further, these results imply that the fraction of global carbon buried by lakes will be increasingly important in the future if worldwide trends in anthropogenic eutrophication continue.  2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC." ;

Despite the region's importance, changes in Indo-Pacific hydroclimate on orbital timescales remain poorly constrained. Here we present high-resolution geochemical records of surface runoff and vegetation from sediment cores from Lake Towuti, on the island of Sulawesi in central Indonesia, that continuously span the past 60,000 y. We show that wet conditions and rainforest ecosystems on Sulawesi present during marine isotope stage 3 (MIS3) and the Holocene were interrupted by severe drying between 33,000 and 16,000 y B.P. when Northern Hemisphere ice sheets expanded and global temperatures cooled. Our record reveals little direct influence of precessional orbital forcing on regional climate, and the similarity between MIS3 and Holocene climates observed in Lake Towuti suggests that exposure of the Sunda Shelf has a weaker influence on regional hydroclimate and terrestrial ecosystems than suggested previously. We infer that hydrological variability in this part of Indonesia varies strongly in response to high-latitude climate forcing, likely through reorganizations of the monsoons and the position of the intertropical convergence zone. These findings suggest an important role for the tropical western Pacific in amplifying glacial-interglacial climate variability." ;

Oxygen and carbon stable isotopes in modern and fossil species assemblages of Lago Peten Itza were used as indicators of changes in the balance between evaporation and precipitation, past lake level and carbon source. Ostracode taphonomy was used to detect past periods of strong currents, high-energy environments, and possible partial or full mixing of the lake. The modern lake water isotopic composition displays clear seasonal differences that are independent of lake level fluctuations. Modern benthic species displayed lower 18O and 13C values than nektobenthic species, with differences of 3.0 and 5.3, respectively. Valves of nektobenthic species display higher values of 13C because these ostracodes live in shallower environments among abundant algae and aquatic plants, where productivity is high. The benthic species Limnocythere opesta Brehm, 1939 displayed the smallest average offset from 18O water (+0.3) and the largest offset from 13CDIC values (4.1) among studied ostracode species. Nektobenthic species Heterocypris punctata Keyser, 1975 displayed the smallest difference relative to the 13CDIC values (0.1). Late Pleistoceneearly Holocene climate conditions and water levels in Lago Peten Itza can be summarized as follows: 1) high lake levels and cold conditions (Last Glacial Maximum [LGM], 2419 ka), 2) fluctuating lake levels and cold conditions (Heinrich Stadial 1 [HS1], 1915 ka), 3) high lake levels and warm and wetter conditions (Blling-Allerd [BA], 1513 ka), 4) low lake levels and dry conditions (Younger Dryas [YD], 1311.5 ka) and 5) high lake levels and warm and wetter conditions (early Holocene, 11.510.0 ka). Average lake level fluctuation in Lago Peten Itza during the late Pleistoceneearly Holocene was as much as 25 m. Ostracode analyses suggest that the LGM was characterized by relatively low 18O (+4.7 to +6.0), and 13C values (7.1 to 6.4) in ostracode valves, high inferred water depths and high percentages of broken adult and juvenile valves (>66%), suggesting a high-energy environment, strong currents, partial to full mixing, downslope transport, colder water temperatures and wetter conditions. An increase in the relative abundance of the benthic species L. opesta and higher numbers of broken valves suggest heavy precipitation events during the LGM (23.7, 21.7, 20.8 and 20.1 ka). HS1 was predominantly dry, but we identified times when lake levels were slightly higher, at the onset of the deglacial and a brief period (1716 ka) between HS1b and HS1a. All studied climate proxies indicate wetter and warmer conditions and lake system stability during the BA. Lake levels dropped during the YD and gradually increased during the Preboreal and early Holocene. We demonstrate that modern and fossil ostracode isotopic signatures, species assemblages and taphonomy can be used together with physical and geochemical variables in Lago Peten Itza sediments to make high-resolution inferences about late Pleistoceneearly Holocene environmental changes in the lowland Neotropics." ;

Our objective is to develop strategies for classifying and comparing late-Holocene charcoal records in Midwestern oak- and pine-dominated sand plain ecosystems where fire regimes include a mix of surface and crown fires. Using standard techniques for the analysis of charcoal from lake sediments, we compiled 1000- to 4000-yr-long records of charcoal accumulation and charcoal peak frequencies from 10 small lakes across a sand plain in northwestern Wisconsin. We used cluster analysis to identify six types of charcoal signatures that differ in their charcoal influx rates, amount of grass charcoal, and frequency and magnitude of charcoal peaks. The charcoal records demonstrate that while fire histories vary among sites, there are regional patterns in the occurrence of charcoal signature types that are consistent with expected differences in fire regimes based on regional climate and vegetation reconstructions. The fire histories also show periods of regional change in charcoal signatures occurring during times of regional climate changes at ~. 700, 1000, and 3500. cal yr BP.  2010 University of Washington." ;

Pollen analysis of a 30-m core indicates that from about 12 000 yr ago until some time after 3000 yr ago, about 30%; of the pollen was carried in by easterly winds from the east Andean forests, which today are at least 600 m lower in elevation. Contemporaneous pollen deposition in lakes on moraines of the last glaciation west of the Junin plain was dominated by local grassland types and had little contribution from this easterly source. At some time after 3000 yr ago (perhaps about 1200 yr ago), the pollen influx to Laguna Junin from this distant forest source greatly diminished, perhaps because of deforestation by increased human populations. Between about 12 000 and 24 000 yr ago in the Junin core, the sparse pollen concentration was dominated by grassland types, supplemented by Polylepis/Acaena, Alnus, and Compositae blown in from the sub-puna shrublands that may have occupied much of the east Andean slopes in place of the humid forest that occurs there today. The silty sediment in this section of the core is interpreted as outwash from piedmont glaciers that invaded the plain, especially from the cordillera to the west. These glaciers left a distinctive pattern of moraines and outwash fans, which served to dam the lake basin. An unconformity in the sediment covers the time from about 24 000 to 39 000 yr ago, when the lake was probably dry. Before this time, the silty sediment and the dominance of grassland and shrubland pollen types indicates an earlier interval of glaciation, recorded on the landscape by an older set of moraines and outwash fans, which initially dammed the lake basin. -Authors" ;

There are several common techniques for measuring MS, each with its own advantages. Here we compare three such techniques measured on a sediment core from Lake Pepin: (a) loop-sensor MS logging on wet sediment of the intact core; (b) point-sensor MS logging on wet sediment of a split (lengthwise) core; and (c) discrete MS measurements of dried subsamples using a susceptibility bridge. To obtain further information about the origin of downcore MS variability, additional magnetic measurements were performed on discrete samples to model ferrimagnetic sedimentary components. Overall trends and individual features in MS curves agree reasonably well between techniques; however, the amplitude of local minima and maxima varies according to the technique used. All three MS techniques captured distinct events c. 1900 and 1940, attributed to increases in allochthonous ferrimagnetic components. The ferrimagnetic particle flux has declined over the past half-century despite increasing sediment accumulation in Lake Pepin, suggesting a possible shift in sediment sources from fields to stream banks." ;

Bogs collectively cover 1236 km2 (16% of the study area) despite the relatively dry regional climate and periodic droughts. 2. The physical, chemical, and biotic properties of these bogs have no apparent relationship to the westward climatic gradient indicating a high degree of buffering from changes in moisture stress. 3. Most bogs are located where groundwater discharge moderates moisture losses to the atmosphere and may decouple bogs from a direct climatic control. Bogs are also consistently related to physiographic features, such as drainage divides, interfluves of tributary streams, and beach ridges that constrain the surface and groundwater hydrology. 4. During droughts groundwater moves upward through the peat column toward the depressed water table, which is located 1-2 m below the peat surface. During moist periods, however, water-table mounds within these bogs drive surface water downward deflecting the deeper upwardly moving groundwater laterally to the bog margins. 5 Such short-term reversals in flow have little effect on the pore-water chemistry of major cartons, which reflect the predominant downward flow over the past decade. Several chemical species, however, behave nonconservatively and respond more directly to climatic change. 6 Discharge zones for groundwater seem to be an essential prerequisite for bog formation in arid regions. Peat accumulation should be most rapid over discharge zones, which can maintain water table mounds, even during droughts. Once a peat mound has formed, its higher water table will drive local recharge cells, which isolate the vegetation from groundwater and facilitate the development of a raised bog." ;

Newgeochemical (X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and elemental analysis) and chronological (optically stimulated luminescence (OSL)) data are used to test for evaporative enrichment within lacustrine sediment from Rabbit Lake, a small basin just above the highest Lake Agassiz strandline, and from two Lake Agassiz sediment cores at Fargo, North Dakota. Increases in quartz and gypsum interpreted to be of aeolian origin suggest increased aridity at Rabbit Lake sometime after 13 540-13 750 cal years BP. From the Fargo cores, lacustrine sediment of the Brenna and Sherack formations did not show convincing evidence for evaporative enrichment. However, this result is complicated by an erosional contact at the top of the Brenna Formation. A thin middle sand unit between the Brenna and Sherack formation clays is stratigraphically equivalent to the Poplar River Formation, West Fargo Member, but its properties differ from the fluvial sand of the West Fargo Member. Four OSL ages from the organic-poor, middle sand unit at Fargo range between 12.8  0.2 and 13.5  0.2 ka (with 1.6 ka uncertainty) and suggest lake level fell at Fargo at, or before, 13.1 0.2 ka, the average of the OSL ages. With different sedimentological properties, and a difference of1750 years between the new OSL ages and previously published ages on the West Fargo Member sand, additional work is required to determine whether the middle sand unit is a new member of the Poplar River Formation, recording an earlier and different depositional environment than the West Fargo Member. From a plot of available ages for the Moorhead Phase, the regression remains poorly constrained in time." ;

These laminated sediments are composed of light and dark pluriannual couplets of diatomaceous ooze formed by different processes. Light sediment laminae accumulated during short-term diatom blooms whereas dark sediment laminae represent the baseline limnological conditions during several years of deposition. Oxygen isotope analysis of the dark diatom laminae show a general 18O enrichment trend during the studied period. Comparison of these 18Odiatom values with the previously published lake-level evolution suggests a correlation between 18Odiatom and the precipitation:evaporation ratio, but also with the evolution of other local hydrological factors as changes in the groundwater outflow as well as shifts in the surface:volume ratio of Lago Chungara. The lake expanded (probably increasing this ratio) during the rising lake-level trend due to changes in its morphology, enhancing evaporation. Furthermore, the lake's hydrology was probably modified as the groundwater outflow became sealed by sediments, increasing lake water residence time and potential evaporation. Both factors could cause isotope enrichment.  Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) copyright 2008. Reproduced with the permission of NERC. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd." ;

Policies are being developed in consultation with a national External Advisory Group (EAG), with requested input from the international paleolimnological community. The dynamic growth of national and international coring programs brings exciting new developments in paleolimnology and also brings a growing need for multi-proxy, cost-efficient usage of core material, similar to practices common in the marine sciences. The goals of this shared program and repository are to: (1) curate cores as a material documentation of scientific analysis and basin archives; (2) increase the quality and scope of paleoecological science by developing procedural standards and by facilitating interdisciplinary interaction among scientists; (3) provide community access to cores; and (4) create web-based access to an ongoing, developing data base. LacCore is a community venture and input is welcome in these early stages. The central idea is that curation of lake cores is significantly more than storage. A curation repository requires professional expertise and advice to assure consistent and coherent conventions for Initial Core Descriptions (ICD), data management, sample oversight, and pro-active dissemination of information on opportunities. Careful curation of cores allows maximum core utilization because maintained and documented cores are available for re-sampling, for comparative, interdisciplinary investigations, for application of new proxy techniques, and for correlation of proxies of environmental change across the continents." ;

The 18O record is interpreted to reflect lake level history, and indicates high stands prior to 4000 yr B.P., from 1800 to 2000 yr B.P., and within the last century. This coincides better with the history of lake level change reported for other lakes in africa than did the previous lake level curve for Lake Turkana based on 14C dates of exposed shoreline deposits. The 13C curve roughly parallels the 18O curve, and may reflect the influence of the Omo River plume. Both of the isotope records are strongly cyclic, with periodicites common to both at 80, 120, 150 and 225 yr. Other, somewhat longer periodicites are nearly equal in the two records, and there is close agreement with previously published cycles based on carbonate and lamination thickness analyses in the same Turkana core.  1991." ;

In addition, because of its depth, it has provided an excellent sediment trap that records paleoclimatic information for the 3.6 Myr since its formation. For these two main reasons, because of the importance for impact and paleoclimate research, El'gygytgyn was the subject of an International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) drilling project in 2009. During this project, which, due to its logistical and financial challenges, took almost a decade to come to fruition, a total of 642.3 m of drill core was recovered at two sites, from four holes. The obtained material included sedimentary and impactite rocks. In terms of impactites, which were recovered from 316.08 to 517.30 m depth below lake bottom (mblb), three main parts of that core segment were identified: from 316 to 390 mblb polymict lithic impact breccia, mostly suevite, with volcanic and impact melt clasts that locally contain shocked minerals, in a fine-grained clastic matrix; from 385 to 423 mblb, a brecciated sequence of volcanic rocks including both felsic and mafic (basalt) members; and from 423 to 517 mblb, a greenish rhyodacitic ignimbrite (mostly monomict breccia). The uppermost impactite (316-328 mblb) contains lacustrine sediment mixed with impact-affected components. Over the whole length of the impactite core, the abundance of shock features decreases rapidly from the top to the bottom of the studied core section. The distinction between original volcanic melt fragments and those that formed later as the result of the impact event posed major problems in the study of these rocks. The sequence that contains fairly unambiguous evidence of impact melt (which is not very abundant anyway, usually less than a few volume%) is only about 75 m thick. The reason for this rather thin fallback impactite sequence may be the location of the drill core on an elevated part of the central uplift. A general lack of large coherent melt bodies is evident, similar to that found at the similarly sized Bosumtwi impact crater in Ghana that, however, was formed in a target composed of a thin layer of sediment above crystalline rocks." ;

Additional mechanisms, such as interactions between atmospheric circulation, ice-sheet dynamics, and the influence of solar irradiance, also have been proposed to explain abrupt climatic events, but evidence remains elusive. This study presents evidence from multi-proxy analyses on the Holocene sediments of Eleanor Lake, interior British Columbia. Climatic inferences from our decadal-resolution record of biogenic silica (BSi) abundance are supported by changes in diatom and pollen assemblages from the same core and correlations with existing regional climate records. The BSi record reveals abrupt and persistent climatic shifts at 10.2, 9.3, and 8.5. ka, the latter two of which are coeval with major collapses of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The record also reveals a short-term cooling at 8.2. ka that is distinct from the 8.5. ka event and similar in magnitude to several other late-Holocene coolings. BSi is correlated with solar-irradiance indices (r=0.43-0.61), but the correlation is opposite in sign to that expected from direct solar forcing and weakens after 8. ka. Possible mechanisms causing the abrupt and persistent climate changes of the early Holocene include 1) sudden losses of ice and proglacial lake extent, causing a shift in the meridional structure of atmospheric circulation, 2) a possible link between solar minima and El Nino-like conditions that are correlated with warm spring temperature in interior British Columbia, and 3) the influence of solar irradiance variability on the position of the polar jet, possibly via effects on the strength of the glacial anticyclone.  2011 Elsevier Ltd." ;

The lake is hydrologically closed and the water balance is controlled mostly by groundwater input and evaporation. Three main modern depositional sub-environments can be recognized as: (i) a carbonate-producing 'littoral platform'; (ii) a steep 'talus' dominated by reworking of littoral sediments and mass-wasting processes; and (iii) an 'offshore, distal area', seasonally affected by anoxia with fine-grained, clastic sediment deposition. A seismic survey identified up to 15 m thick sedimentary infill comprising: (i) a 'basal unit', seismically transparent and restricted to the depocentres of both sub-basins; (ii) an 'intermediate unit' characterized by continuous high-amplitude reflections; and (iii) an 'upper unit' with strong parallel reflectors. Several mass-wasting deposits occur in both sub-basins. Five sediment cores were analysed using sedimentological, microscopic, geochemical and physical techniques. The chronological model for the sediment sequence is based on 17 accelerator mass spectrometry 14C dates. Five depositional environments were characterized by their respective sedimentary facies associations. The depositional history of Lake Estanya during the last ca 21 kyr comprises five stages: (i) a brackish, shallow, calcite-producing lake during full glacial times (21 to 173 kyr bp); (ii) a saline, permanent, relatively deep lake during the late glacial (173 to 116 kyr bp); (iii) an ephemeral, saline lake and saline mudflat complex during the transition to the Holocene (116 to 94 kyr bp); (iv) a saline lake with gypsum-rich, laminated facies and abundant microbial mats punctuated by periods of more frequent flooding episodes and clastic-dominated deposition during the Holocene (94 to 08 kyr bp); and (v) a deep, freshwater to brackish lake with high clastic input during the last 800years. Climate-driven hydrological fluctuations are the main internal control in the evolution of the lake during the last 21 kyr, affecting water salinity, lake-level changes and water stratification. However, external factors, such as karstic processes, clastic input and the occurrence of mass-flows, are also significant. The facies model defined for Lake Estanya is an essential tool for deciphering the main factors influencing lake deposition and to evaluate the most suitable proxies for lake level, climate and environmental reconstructions, and it is applicable to modern karstic lakes and to ancient lacustrine formations.  2009 The Authors.

We use palynological evidence from a Central American lake on the Yucatan Peninsula to evaluate the effects of rapid climate changes during the last ice age, between 65 and 8ka. Location Lake Peten-Itza, lowlands of northern Guatemala. Methods Sediment core PI-6 was sampled at c.170-year resolution for pollen and charcoal analysis in order to construct a temporal sequence of environmental change. Uni- and multivariate statistical analyses were performed on the pollen dataset to test whether there was an association between Heinrich events in the North Atlantic and vegetation changes in the Central American lowlands. Results Pollen analysis revealed that the composition of plant assemblages on the Yucatan Peninsula varied in phase with rapid changes in North Atlantic climate. Pine savannas were the main vegetation type between c.60 and 47ka. These savannas gave way to pine-oak (Pinus-Quercus) forests in the latter half of the last ice age. Marked episodes of replacement of the pine-oak assemblage by xeric-tolerant taxa occurred during Heinrich events. The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was characterized by mesic conditions. Main conclusions The pollen record from Lake Peten-Itza showed that vegetation changes associated with Heinrich events were more significant than those associated with the LGM. Each Heinrich event produced a characteristic shift towards xeric taxa. Although colder than Heinrich events, the LGM on the Yucatan Peninsula was relatively moist, and the presumed savannization of the landscape during the maximum cooling of the last glacial was not supported by our data. Our findings suggest alternative scenarios for plant diversification and genetic interchange during glacial times, and also indicate that vegetation in tropical continental settings was not as stable as previously thought.  2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd." ;

At Moon Lake, a closed-basin lake in eastern North Dakota, a comparison of diatom-inferred salinity and the precipitation-based Bhalme-Mooley Drought Index (BMDI) over the last 100 years was highly significant, suggesting that the diatom record contains a sensitive archive of past climatic conditions. A sub-decadal record of inferred salinity for the past 2300 years indicates that extreme droughts of greater intensity than those during the 1930s 'Dust Bowl' were more frequent prior to A.D. 1200. This high frequency of extreme droughts persisted for centuries and was most pronounced from A.D. 200-370, A.D. 700-850 and A.D. 1000-1200. A pronounced shift to generally wetter conditions with less severe droughts of shorter duration occured at A.D. 1200. This abrupt change coincided with the end of the 'Medieval Warm Period' (A.D. 1000-1200) and the onset of the 'Little Ice Age' (A.D. 1300-1850)." ;

We inferred past climate conditions and anthropogenic impacts using geochemical and biological (pollen and diatoms) variables in the dated sequences, in conjunction with temperature and precipitation data collected since 1871 at meteorological stations in the region. The record provides evidence of environmental changes during the last 200 years. At the end of the Little Ice Age (~1800-1875 AD) the region was characterized by an open landscape. Long-term use of the area for mixed livestock grazing in the mountains, and cultivation of rye during the nineteenth century, contributed to the expansion of grassland at the expense of forest. Warmer temperatures since the end of the nineteenth century are inferred from a change in diatom assemblages and development of the local forest. Socioeconomic transformation during the twentieth century, such as livestock changes related to dairy specialization, planting of non-native trees, mining activities, and management of the national park since its creation in 1918, caused profound changes in the catchment and in the lake ecology. The last several decades (~1970-2007 AD) of the Lago Enol sediment record are strikingly different from previous periods, indicating lower runoff and increasing lake productivity, particularly since AD 2000. Today, the large number of tourists who visit the area cause substantial impacts on this ecosystem.  2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

The chronology is established by over 50 AMS radiocarbon dates. This record exhibits millennial-scale trends evident in other lower-resolution studies, but with much more detail on short-term climate variability and on the rapidity and timing of major climatic shifts. As a proxy for precipitation, we utilize the rate of endogenic carbonate sedimentation, which depends on groundwater inflow, which in turn depends on precipitation. Independent cluster analyses of mineral and pollen data reveal major Holocene mode shifts at 10.73 ka (ka = cal yr BP), 9.25 ka, and 4.44 ka. The early Holocene, 11.7-9.25 ka, was generally wet, with perhaps a trend to higher evaporation associated with warming temperatures. A switch from calcite to aragonite deposition associated with a severe, but brief drought occurred at 10.73 ka. From 10.73 ka to 9.25 ka, climate was generally humid but punctuated at 100-300 yr intervals by brief droughts, including the most severe drought of the entire Holocene at 9.25 ka. This event was coeval with the 9.3-9.2 ka event in the Greenland ice cores and observed at a number of sites worldwide. In contrast, the prominent 8.2 ka event in Greenland is not remarkable at Kettle Lake. The prominence of the 9.25 event locally in the NGP may be due to a major drawdown and northward retreat of Lake Agassiz at this time, reducing its mesoclimatic effect on the NGP and thrusting the region into an insolation controlled regime. The mid-Holocene, 9.25-4.44 ka, was characterized by great variability in moisture on a multi-decadal scale, with severe droughts alternating with more humid periods. The high abundance of the weedy but drought intolerant Ambrosia generally during the mid-Holocene and specifically during the multi-decadal drought periods is seemingly paradoxical, but can be explained by high interannual variability of moisture overlaid on the multi-decadal variability. The late Holocene, 4.44 ka-present, was also characterized by multi-decadal variability in moisture, but was generally wetter than the mid-Holocene and the magnitude of variability was less. The trends in wet-dry mineral, pollen, and charcoal proxies were similar to the mid-Holocene, but late Holocene mineral-pollen assemblages are distinct from mid-Holocene. The shift to wetter climate in the late Holocene was more gradual than the abrupt shift to arid conditions 9.25 ka, which may explain the asymmetric retreat and readvance of forest along the eastern margin of the NGP. Precipitation variations in the NGP have been linked with Pacific and Atlantic sea-surface temperatures, and mid-Holocene drought in the NGP has been linked with sustained La Nina-like conditions in the Pacific. These linkages may explain the decadal- and millennial-scale variations seen in the NGP, but cause of the prominent century-scale variations remains elusive.  2011 Elsevier Ltd." ;

ns3:c99bd2bf\-c563\-30e5\-98da\-ad3b2ddc51d0	ns2:abstracttext	"The lower Ohio River valley is a terraced fluvial landscape that has been profoundly influenced by Quaternary climate change and glaciation. A modern Quaternary chronostratigraphic framework was developed for the lower Ohio River valley using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating and allostratigraphic mapping to gain insights into the nature of fluvial responses to glacialinterglacial/stadialinterstadial transitions and Holocene climate change. River deposits, T0 (youngest) to T7 (oldest), were mapped along a 75 km reach of the lower Ohio River and were dated using 46 OSL and 5 radiocarbon samples. The examination of cores combined with OSL and radiocarbon dating shows that fluvial sediments older than marine oxygen isotope stage (MIS) 2 are present only in the subsurface. Aggradation during MIS 6 (Illinoian glaciation) filled the valley to within 7 m of the modern floodplain, and by 114 ka (MIS 5e/Sangamon interglacial) the Ohio River had scoured the MIS 6 sediments to 22 m below the modern floodplain surface. There were no fluvial sediments in the valley with ages between MIS 5e and the middle of MIS 3. The MIS 3 ages (39 ka) and stratigraphic position of T5 deposits suggest the Ohio River aggraded 814 m during MIS 4 or MIS 3. Near the end of MIS 3, the Ohio River incised the mid Last Glacial (mid-Wisconsinan) deposits 10 m and began aggrading again by 30 ka. Aggradation continued into MIS 2, with maximum MIS 2 aggradation occurring before 21 ka, which is coincident with the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). As the Ohio River adjusted to changing fluxes in sediment load and discharge following the LGM, it formed a sequence of fill-cut terraces in the MIS 2 outwash that get progressively younger with decreasing elevation, ranging in age from 21 ka to 13 ka. From 14 ka to 13 ka the Ohio River rapidly incised 3 m to form a new terrace, and by 12 ka at the onset of the Holocene, the Ohio River established a meandering channel pattern. The river formed a broad floodplain surface from 12 ka to 6 ka, and then incised 1 m and formed a fill-cut terrace from 6 ka to 5 ka. After 5 ka, likely in response to mid-Holocene drought in North America, the Ohio River incised 5 m, and by 4 ka the river began aggrading again. The Ohio River has aggraded 4 m since aggradation began at 4 ka. The chronostratigraphic framework and reconstructed history developed here suggest that the lower Ohio River is highly sensitive to glacialinterglacial transitions and abrupt Holocene climate change and responds rapidly to these allogenic forcings." ;

The lake is in an explosion crater formed during Quaternary time. The very laminated sediment is composed mostly of clay containing 5-10% organic carbon. Each couplet is commonly composed of a basal lamina rich in quartz, plant debris, muscovite and sponge spicules, and of a more clayey upper lamina often with siderite. A perturbed section near the base of the core, before ca. 21,000 yr B.P., could be the result of a violent release of gas, such CO2, comparable to the recent Nyos gas eruption. The paleomagnetic studies exhibit high-frequency oscillations interpreted as paleosecular variations of the local geomagnetic field. This first record obtained on the African continent can be closely compared to the type record obtained in Western Europe. The pollen results demonstrate the presence of a forest refuge in West Cameroon during the last great arid period, ca. 18,000 yr B.P. When equatorial forest was broken up, elements of montane vegetation spread to the lowlands. These phenomena resulted from a drying and cooling climate.  1990." ;

I examined the hypothesis that burning was more frequent during wet years using charcoal to reconstruct fire histories near Coldwater Lake in southcentral ND, and Rice Lake in northcentral ND and published records of ostracod Mg/Ca ratios as a proxy for climate at these same two sites. Over the past 10000 years, charcoal influx rates for Coldwater (0.04-5.68 mm2 cm-2 year-1) greatly exceeded influx rates for Rice (<0.01-1.91 mm2 cm-2 year-1). Both sites showed strong, significant periodicities of 1500-1800, 800-900 and 130-140 years but charcoal maxima and minima were only similar at 4200 cal years BP. Charcoal influx during the past 2000 years also revealed strong periodicities of between 310-400 and 140 years at both sites. Comparison of smoothed charcoal influxes and ostracod Mg/Ca ratios suggests that both proxies are responding to changes in climate. When smoothed with a 320-400-year window, increases in charcoal influx typically preceded rises in ostracod Mg/Ca ratio by 50-100 years, and further smoothing (140-year window) of the residuals suggested a variable relationship between Mg/Ca ratios and charcoal influx. These results do not clearly support or reject the fuel limitation hypothesis, and this lack of clear support may result from (a) climate-driven shifts in the mix of C3 and C4 grasses resulting in maximum productivity at intermediate moisture levels, (b) possibly different responses of charcoal and Mg/Ca ratios to summer vs. winter precipitation, or (c) ground-water driven lags in the response of Mg/Ca ratios to shifts in climate. Comparison of the results from this study with other studies suggests that links between fire and fuels at finer time scales (0-100 years) may be broadly constrained by longer term (500-2000 years) patterns of climate in the northern Great Plains.  2004 Elsevier B.V.

Our results document lake level fluctuations in this lowland Neotropical region that were related to glacial-to-interglacial climate change during the Late Pleistocene. A bathymetric survey of Lake Peten Itza (area = 100 km2) revealed a maximum water depth of ~160 m and the existence of a deep cryptodepression that extends 50 m below modern sea level. The great depth suggests that the basin held water even during arid conditions associated with full glacial periods. Lake Peten Itza may thus possess the only long continuous lacustrine sediment record of Late Pleistocene environmental and climate change in the lowland Neotropics. Two seismic reflection campaigns imaged the subsurface basin sediments that overlie basement. The sediment package was divided into four major seismic sequences (T, G, R, and B). Sequences are separated by unconformities that represent depositional cycles related to lake level fluctuations. Sediments of the uppermost sequence (T) were recovered and radiocarbon-dated in Kullenberg piston cores taken along a water depth transect. Seismic profiles reveal a basin-wide paleoshoreline just below sequence T at ~56 m below present lake level. This constructional feature formed during a lowstand of the last glacial period when the lake was reduced to only ~13% of its present volume. In cores taken landward of the paleoshoreline, Late Glacial-age deposits consist of paleosols, indicating subaerial exposure. Basinward of the shoreline, sediments are composed of dense gypsum sands and interbedded silty clays, reflecting authigenic gypsum formation under arid climate conditions. The top of the soil horizon and cessation of gypsum precipitation are represented by a strong seismic reflection (t). It marks the base of the uppermost seismic sequence T and is dated in several cores between ~11.1 and 10.2 cal kyr BP. Lake level rose quickly at this time in response to a shift from arid-to-humid climate conditions at the Late Glacial/Early Holocene transition. We infer a similar sediment response to climate variations in the older stratigraphic sequences (G, R, and B), related to earlier glacial-to-interglacial and stadial-to-interstadial cycles. Older sequences are also distinguished from one another by erosional unconformities that probably represent major lake level falls. Future recovery of the older stratigraphic record by drilling in Lake Peten Itza will provide ages for these older units and enable us to test the depositional model inferred from seismic stratigraphy." ;

The continuing degradation of Lake Victoria's ecological functions has serious long-term consequences for the ecosystem services it provides, and may threaten social welfare in the countries bordering its shores. Evaluation of recent ecological changes in the context of aquatic food-web alterations, catchment disturbance and natural ecosystem variability has been hampered by the scarcity of historical monitoring data. Here, we present high-resolution palaeolimnological data, which show that increases in phytoplankton production developed from the 1930s onwards, which parallels human-population growth and agricultural activity in the Lake Victoria drainage basin. Dominance of bloom-forming cyanobacteria since the late 1980s coincided with a relative decline in diatom growth, which can be attributed to the seasonal depletion of dissolved silica resulting from 50 years of enhanced diatom growth and burial. Eutrophication-induced loss of deep-water oxygen started in the early 1960s, and may have contributed to the 1980s collapse of indigenous fish stocks by eliminating suitable habitat for certain deep-water cichlids. Conservation of Lake Victoria as a functioning ecosystem is contingent upon large-scale implementation of improved land-use practices." ;

Sediment samples were taken every 10 m from the core MAL05-1C to 80 m in depth and then from that depth in core MAL05-1B to 382 m. Sediment samples were then later taken at a higher resolution of every 2 m from MAL05-1C. They were then leached to remove the authigenic fraction, the leachate was processed to separate out the beryllium isotopes, and 10Be was measured at the TAMS Facility at the University of Arizona. The 10Be/9Be profile from Lake Malawi sediments is similar to those derived from marine sediment cores for the late Pleistocene, and is consistent with the few radiocarbon and OSL IR measurements made from the same core. Nevertheless, a strong correlation between the stable isotope 9Be and the cosmogenic isotope 10Be suggests that both isotopes have been well mixed before deposition unlike in some marine sediment cores. In addition, the correlation of beryllium isotopes to a proxy of lake level TOC (Total Organic Matter) from Lake Malawi indicates that the concentrations of 10Be in the lake sediments result from the combined effects of global and local climates on lake level, local hydrology, and sediment transport in the Lake Malawi basin rather than as a direct response to its production in the atmosphere modulated by the intensity of the Earth's dipole. Therefore, a direct correlation of the 10Be/9Be to a chronology derived from the paleomagnetic variations measured from marine sediments was not possible. Nevertheless, a comparison of the 10Be/9Be chronology, allowing for decay, at Lake Malawi to that of the global marine paleomagnetic record suggests that the bottom of core MAL05-1B is no more than 750 ka in age." ;

Following deglaciation, the landscape surrounding Dailey Lake was sparsely vegetated, and erosional input into the lake was high. As summer insolation increased and ice recessional processes subsided, Picea parkland developed and diatoms established in the lake at 13,300 cal yr BP. Closed subalpine forests of Picea, Abies, and Pinus established at 12,300 cal yr BP followed by the development of open Pinus and Pseudotsuga forests at 10,200 cal yr BP. Increased planktic diatom abundance indicates a step-like warming at 13,100 cal yr BP, and alternations between planktic and tychoplankic taxa suggest changes in lake thermal structure between 12,400 and 11,400 cal yr BP. An increasingly open forest, in combination with increased benthic diatoms, indicates warm dry summers during the early Holocene after 11,400 cal yr BP, in contrast to nearby records in northern Yellowstone that register prolonged summer-wet conditions until ca. 8000 cal yr BP. Because of its low elevation, Dailey Lake was apparently sensitive to the direct effects of increased summer insolation on temperature and effective moisture, registering dry summers. In contrast, higher elevations in northern Yellowstone responded to the indirect effects of an amplified seasonal insolation cycle on atmospheric circulation, including elevated winter snowpack and/or increased summer convective storms as a result of enhanced monsoonal circulation." ;

The reconstructed vegetation records are mostly independent of Bear Lake's hydrologic state and are therefore useful for identifying times when climate forcing contributed to lake changes. The Bear Lake pollen results indicate that significant changes in the Bear Lake vegetation occurred during the intervals 15,300-13,900, 12,000-10,000, 7500-6700, 6700-5300, 3800-3600, and 2200-1300 cal yr B.P. These intervals coincide with regional shifts in vegetation and climate, documented in pollen, isotope and biogeographic records in the Basin and Range region, suggesting that large-scale climate was the primary forcing factor for these intervals of change. Maximum aridity and warmth is indicated from 12,000 to 7500 cal yr B.P., followed by intervals of generally more mesic and cool conditions, especially after 7500 cal yr B.P.

The record begins in the Middle Ages (~AD 800) and ends around AD1920, with an average resolution of ~30 years. The reconstructed vegetation sequence is complex and shows the influence of both climate and humans in shaping the landscape. Pre-feudal times were characterized by the presence of well-developed conifer forests, which were intensely burned at the beginning of feudal times (AD 1000) and were replaced by cereal (rye) and hemp cultivation, as well as meadows and pastures. In the thirteenth century, a relatively short period of warming, likely corresponding to the Medieval Warm Period, was inferred from the presence of a low Mediterranean scrub community that is today restricted to <800 m elevation. This community disappeared during Little Ice Age cooling in the fifteenth century, coinciding with a decline in human activities around the lake. Forest recovery began around AD 1500, at the beginning of the Modern period, coinciding with wetter climate. Forests, however, declined again during the seventeenth century, coinciding with maximum olive and hemp cultivation. This situation was reversed in post-Modern times (nineteenth century), characterized by an intense agricultural crisis and a significant decline in population that favored forest re-expansion. Correlations with nearby Estanya Lake, situated about 350 m below, provide a regional picture of environmental change. Besides some climate forcing evident in both sequences, human activities seem to have been the main drivers of landscape and vegetation change in the southern Pyrenean flank, in agreement with conclusions from other studies in high-mountain environments." ;

Cumbres Bog is unusually deep (basal sediments extend 12 m below the surface) for its altitude (~3050 m a.s.l.) and we extracted 7 m core of continuous sediment below ~5 m of water and peat. The resulting record provides strong evidence of: a period of warming immediately after the LGM (~18-13 cal. kyr BP), a cool interval coinciding with the Younger Dryas (~12.8-11.5 cal. kyr BP), a warm stable period from 10 to 6 cal. kyr BP, and a cooler and highly variable climate interval after 6 cal. kyr BP. More specifically, pollen ratios and fossil diatoms indicate that cold periods generally match with previously identified periods of rapid climate change that occurred at 10.6, 8.7-7.9, 7.0-6.9, 5.4-5.2, 3.3-3.0, 2.3, 2.0 and 1.5 cal. kyr BP. This record also adds resolution to previous regional records and indicates that the periodicity of climate variability changed from 2000-3000 years to 700-1100 years around 6 cal. kyr BP and to <500 years after 3.5 cal. kyr BP. Overall, our record provides important, relatively high-resolution paleoclimatic information for this remote region of the southern Rockies.  The Author(s) 2013." ;

Many of the intervals of high directional dispersion were previously interpreted to record magnetic excursions. For the upper ~120 m, these interpretations were tested using the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS), which typically defines a subhorizontal planar fabric for sediments deposited in quiet water. AMS data from intervals of deformed core, determined from detailed analysis of sedimentary structures, were compared to a reference AMS fabric derived from undisturbed sediment. This comparison shows that changes in the AMS fabric provide a means of screening core samples for deformation and the associated paleomagnetic record for the adverse effects of distortion. For that portion of core OL-92 studied here (about the upper 120 m), the combined analyses of sedimentary structures and AMS data demonstrate that most of the paleomagnetic features, previously interpreted as geomagnetic excursions, are likely the result of core deformation.

The cores span the last ~525 years of sediment accumulation in the basin. This study explores lake level and trophic state changes that Lago Peten Itza has experienced since European contact in the early 1500s. We inferred past environmental variability using changes in sediment geochemistry and fluctuations in relative species abundances of ostracode and chironomid fossil assemblages. Changes in concentrations of organic matter (OM), carbonate, total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), C/N ratios, bromine (Br), and faunal relative abundances were used to infer changes in the trophic status of the lake. Cultural eutrophication began in the 1930s, and anthropogenic impact increased significantly after ~1970. Higher linear sedimentation rates, up to 9.1 mm yr-1, began recently. They are attributed to increases in riparian settlement, deforestation and associated land use changes, which led to accelerated soil erosion. An ostracode-based transfer function was applied to assemblages in core PI-SC-1-10m, which enabled us to identify periods when lake level fluctuated. Such historical fluctuations in lake levels were driven primarily by changes in rainfall. Past lake levels can be summarized as follows: (1) fluctuating, high lake levels from ~1550s to the 1730s and from the early 1940s to 2005, and (2) stable, lower lake levels from about 1750 to the early 1900s. Higher relative abundance of the ostracode Physocypria globula and higher rubidium (Rb) concentrations indicate higher lake levels than today. Chironomids also show sharp fluctuations along the cores that could be related to water level changes. The presence of chironomid assemblages Chironomus, Procladius, and Einfeldia from 1960-2000 AD shows high productivity levels. The Lago Peten Itza sediment record indicates a generally arid Little Ice Age (LIA), with exceptions around 1580 and 1650 when high lake levels similar to those of the 20th century, i.e. ~5 m higher than today, indicate more humid conditions." ;

ns3:ce673e5d\-f371\-37df\-810a\-789a0e0e6c19	ns2:abstracttext	"Although sediment is a natural constituent of rivers, excess loading to rivers and streams is a leading cause of impairment and biodiversity loss. Remedial actions require identification of the sources and mechanisms of sediment supply. This task is complicated by the scale and complexity of large watersheds as well as changes in climate and land use that alter the drivers of sediment supply. Previous studies in Lake Pepin, a natural lake on the Mississippi River, indicate that sediment supply to the lake has increased 10-fold over the past 150 years. Herein we combine geochemical fingerprinting and a suite of geomorphic change detection techniques with a sediment mass balance for a tributary watershed to demonstrate that, although the sediment loading remains very large, the dominant source of sediment has shifted from agricultural soil erosion to accelerated erosion of stream banks and bluffs, driven by increased river discharge. Such hydrologic amplification of natural erosion processes calls for a new approach to watershed sediment modeling that explicitly accounts for channel and floodplain dynamics that amplify or dampen landscape processes. Further, this finding illustrates a new challenge in remediating nonpoint sediment pollution and indicates that management efforts must expand from soil erosion to factors contributing to increased water runoff." ;

The Enol glacier retreated from its maximum extent prior to 40 ka BP as demonstrated by the onset of proglacial lacustrine sedimentation in two glaciated depressions: the Comella hollow to the north (before 40 ka BP) and the Lago Enol (before 38 ka BP). These results support previous evidence that the maximum extent of southern European glaciers occurred earlier than in northern Europe. Alternation of homogeneous and laminated proglacial sediments during the glacier retreat illustrate a dynamic glacial evolution during the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 (4026 ka BP). A slight warming is detected at 26 ka ago with the change from proglacial sediments (in a lake located in contact to the glacier) to glaciolacustrine sedimentation (in a non-contact or distal lake). Finally, the onset of organic-rich sediments took place at 18 ka ago. This last transition occurred in two phases, similarly to the North Atlantic Last Termination, suggesting a link between North Atlantic Deep Water formation oscillations and palaeohydrological variability in the Cantabrian Mountains.

The model uses a monthly water and isotope balance approach with simplified water-column structure and groundwater exchanges. The framework for comparative simulations is provided by lakes in a region of the Northern Rocky Mountains that display high interlake geochemical variability, thought to be controlled by groundwater hydraulics. Our analysis highlights several isotopic effects of flow between aquifers and lakes, leading to possible divergence of isotopic paleorecords formed under a common climate. Amplitude of isotopic variation resulting from simulated climate forcing was greatly damped when high groundwater fluxes and/or low lake volume resulted in low lake fluid residence time. Differing precipitation and evaporation scenarios that are equivalent in annual fluid balance (P-E) resulted in different isotopic signatures, interpreted as a result of evaporation kinetics. Concentrating low- groundwater inflow during spring months raised springtime lake  values, a counterintuitive result of coincidence between times of high groundwater inflow and the evaporation season. Transient effects of reduced fluid balance caused excursions opposite in sign from eventual steady-state isotopic shifts resulting from enhanced groundwater inflow dominance. Lags in response between climate forcing and isotopic signals were shortened by high groundwater fluxes and resulting short lake residence times. Groundwater-lake exchange exerts control over patterns of lake isotopic response to evaporation through effects on lake residence time, inflow composition, and seasonal timing of inflow and outflow. Sediments from groundwater-linked lakes, often used for paleoenvironmental analysis, should be expected to reflect isotopic complexities of the type shown here.  2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc." ;

The cycling of these two forms of carbon makes a \"carbon pump\" that greatly affects the biogeochemical cycles of other elements. To further understand these biogeochemical dynamics, the lakes, streams, and wetlands of the Shingobee River headwater area of north-central Minnesota have been subjected to intensive hydrologic and biogeochemical studies. Williams Lake, situated close to the highest point in the regional flow system, is hydrologically closed, with no surface inlet or outlet, and ground water and precipitation as the only sources of water. Shingobee Lake, situated at the lowest point in the regional flow system, has the Shingobee River as an inlet and outlet. The surface waters of both lakes are oversaturated, and the bottom waters undersaturated, with respect to CaCO 3 during the summer. The small amount of CaCO 3 that is precipitated in the epilimnion of Williams Lake during the summer is dissolved in the undersaturated hypolimnion and sediments with the result that no CaCO 3 is incorporated into the profundal surface sediments. Because of the high phytoplankton productivity of Shingobee Lake, sufficient CaCO 3 is produced in the epilimnion that large amounts survive the corrosive hypolimnion and sediments, and an average of 46 wt. % accumulates in surface sediments. Another consequence of higher phytoplankton productivity in Shingobee Lake is that the hypolimnion becomes oxygen deficient within a month after overturn in both the spring and fall. Because of reducing conditions that develop in the hypolimnion of Shingobee Lake, high concentrations of dissolved Fe and Mn accumulate there during summer stratification. Precipitation of Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides during periods of fall and spring overturn results in high concentrations of Fe and Mn in surface sediments. In Williams Lake, high concentrations of Fe and Mn do not build up in the hypolimnion. The concentration of CaCO 3 is about 80 wt. % in lower Holocene sediments of both lakes. The lower Holocene sediments in both lakes also contain high concentrations of Fe and Mn, and the lower Holocene sediments of Shingobee are laminated. The waters of both lakes had identical values of  13C and  18O during the early Holocene, but the waters of Williams Lake \"evolved\" during the early Holocene, increasing about 10 in both  13C and  18O. Deposits of lacustrine marl occur as much as seven meters above the present elevation of Williams Lake, the highest of the two lakes. Taken together, these observations suggest that the lakes were once connected to form a larger lake called Lake Willobee with a hypolimnion that was anoxic, at least seasonally." ;

These records from the southern tropical Andes provide supporting evidence that the early Holocene (between 12 and 8 ka) was relatively warm and dry, and the middle Holocene (between 8 and 4 ka) was marked by a shift to cooler, and possibly wetter conditions in certain regions, leading to glacial advances. Although there were multiple periods of brief ice advances that interrupted the overall trend, glaciers in multiple valleys generally retreated from 4.0 ka through the Medieval Climate Anomaly (1.00.7 ka). This late Holocene pattern of ice retreat occurred during a period when lake level studies, and both lacustrine and speleothem stable isotopic records indicate wetter conditions relative to the middle Holocene, suggesting that higher temperatures contributed to the pattern of ice retreat. Following this period of glacial retreat, multiple proxy records suggest that the start of the Little Ice Age (0.60.1 ka) was a colder and wetter time throughout much of the tropical Andes. There appear to be two primary synoptic-scale climatic controls on temperature and precipitation linked to insolation dynamics that drive changes in ice cover in the southern tropical Andes during the Holocene: 1) the strength of the South America Summer Monsoon, which is linked to Northern Hemisphere temperatures and the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone over the Atlantic, and 2) sea surface temperature distributions in the tropical Pacific Ocean and its influence on atmospheric temperature, precipitation and circulation patterns." ;

Yet few records of their drainage come from observations within their basins. Sediment cores from nine lakes along a 240-km transect from northwestern Quebec to northeastern Ontario cover a portion of former Lake Ojibway and provide a stratigraphy of the terminal phase of this large glacial lake. Magnetic susceptibility, density, grain size, X-ray fluorescence chemistry and X-ray diffraction data were used to characterize stratigraphic changes within the basin. The basal sequence consists of till and rhythmites, with ice-proximal debris flows overlain by varves. The varves thin up-section and become unrecognizable, which indicates decreased deposition rates. This fine-grained sediment forms the matrix of a clay-pebble conglomerate. The clay-pebbles are ice-rafted debris (IRD). The IRD flux was probably constant, whereas the sedimentation rate of the finer-grained matrix decreased. The end of IRD marks the cessation of icebergs in the lake and is the best indication for drainage of the glacial lake. The conglomerate is capped by laminated to massive gray silt deposited after lake drainage and marks the transition to organic-rich, post-glacial lakes. Such sequences place drainage into the broader context of deglaciation.  2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht." ;

Acidic bog waters are neutralized below 0.5 m in the peat profile. A small change in the volume of groundwater discharge in the peatland may therefore be sufficient to neutralize the acidic waters on the bog surface and greatly affect the vegetation.-from Authors" ;

Our study site, Lago Cardiel (49S), lies within the modern influence of the Southern Westerlies and, therefore, is ideally located to track the past migrations of these storm tracks. With a coring strategy taking into account the lateral differences in sedimentation and an excellent core-to-core correlation using tephra layers, a composite sedimentological record of almost 25 m was established covering the last 16,000 cal yr. Sedimentological and petrophysical analysis of the cores revealed the establishment of a dominant lake current since 6800 cal yr BP leading to a drift deposition, which is especially well-expressed in the sedimentary record by an increase in magnetic susceptibility values. As this pattern of currents is most likely induced by wind activity, we propose that the observed increase in magnetic susceptibility documents an intensification of the westerly storm tracks. This intensification occurred slightly earlier than previously suggested based on palynological evidence. The strengthening in the Southern Westerlies during the mid-Holocene is most likely caused by an increase in the temperature gradient as a result of enhanced influence and/or southward migration of the Southeast Pacific anticyclone and a larger Antarctic sea-ice extent.  2005 Elsevier B.V.

Core 04-SVID-03 represents a 12,000 cal. yrs BP to present record. Large magnitude changes in 18O occurred during the Holocene at the site. Downcore shifts in 18O of chironomids did not correlate with measurements of the 13C and 15N of chironomid head capsules, implying that the 18O changes were not primarily driven by changes in chironomid diet during the Holocene. The D of TOM provided a proxy of relative lake-water D changes at the site and also showed large magnitude changes during the record. This approach was supported by analyses of a modern training set where DTOM analyses were conducted using surface sediments from a suite of freshwater lakes over a large latitudinal gradient. The magnitude of changes in both the 18O and D and the relatively negative 18O values throughout much of the core suggest that the proxies represent more paleoenvironmental information than solely temperature. Additional possible influences on lake-water isotopic composition are discussed, including changes in the seasonality of precipitation, in the patterns of air masses supplying precipitation to Iceland and in the dominant mode of the North Atlantic Oscillation.  2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

The Pliocene is a period of particular interest because CO2 forcing was comparable to today and yet Arctic temperatures were significantly warmer than today. Here we describe an atmospheric general circulation model experiment assessing the response of terrestrial temperatures in the mid-Pliocene (3.02 to 3.26 Ma) to an ice-free Arctic, and we compare the simulation with a compilation of proxy-based Pliocene paleotemperature reconstructions. Our experiments indicate that the amplification of Arctic surface temperatures is much more sensitive to the extent of sea ice than continental ice. The removal of Arctic sea ice results in simulated mean annual surface temperatures that better match terrestrial proxy data (RMSE = 2.9 C) than experimental conditions that included seasonal sea ice (RMSE = 4.5 C). Our simulations also show a decrease in the seasonal amplitude of temperatures in the absence of sea-ice, which is consistent with theory predicting more equable climates in the Arctic during warmer intervals in Earths history. Our results demonstrate that once sea-ice is removed, latent heat is lost from the ocean to the atmosphere as water vapor that can be circulated by the atmosphere and result in warming of continental interiors. Although our sensitivity experiment does not help to identify the full array of feedback mechanisms responsible for the amplification of Arctic surface temperatures during the Pliocene, it does demonstrate that Arctic terrestrial surface temperatures are extremely sensitive to the spatial and seasonal extent of sea-ice." ;

However, the potential for other environmental variables, such as nutrient concentration, to affect brGDGT distributions remains largely unexplored. We have examined the influence of a suite of environmental factors, including temperature, lake water and sediment chemistry, and lake morphometry on brGDGT concentration and distributions in the surface sediments of 111 lakes in East Africa. We found that temperature was the major control on the distributions, while the influence of pH was relatively minor. Water depth also had a minor but statistically significant influence, perhaps due to the relationship between lake depth and deep water anoxia. Water column nutrient concentration did not have a significant effect on the distributions or concentration. We further explored the potential for these variables to affect brGDGT temperature reconstruction by examining the correlation between them and the residuals of our brGDGT temperature calibration. We found that, while the distribution of some cyclized brGDGTs may be influenced by pH and other environmental variables, they are necessary in brGDGT calibration equations in order to accurately reconstruct temperature, likely due to covariation between temperature and other environmental variables. While surface water pH correlated with the relative abundance of certain brGDGTs, caution should be exhibited when using brGDGTs as a pH proxy because of systematic calibration errors.  2013 Elsevier Ltd." ;

The goals of this project are to document the evolution of plant biodiversity in the Amazon forests and to relate biotic diversification to changes in the physical environment, including climate, tectonism, and the surface landscape. These goals require long sedimentary records from each of the major sedimentary basins across the heart of the Brazilian Amazon, which can only be obtained by drilling because of the scarcity of Cenozoic outcrops. The proposed drilling will provide the first long, nearly continuous regional records of the Cenozoic history of the forests, their plant diversity, and the associated changes in climate and environment. It also will address fundamental questions about landscape evolution, including the history of Andean uplift and erosion as recorded in Andean foreland basins and the development of west-to-east hydrologic continuity between the Andes, the Amazon lowlands, and the equatorial Atlantic. Because many modern rivers of the Amazon basin flow along the major axes of the old sedimentary basins, we plan to locate drill sites on the margin of large rivers and to access the targeted drill sites by navigation along these rivers." ;

Much of the variability in WPWP convection is attributed to variations in the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, for which the long-term trends and forcing mechanisms remain poorly understood. Despite the importance of WPWP convection to global climate change, we have very few paleohydrological reconstructions from the region. Here we present a new paleolimnologic and paleohydrologic record spanning the past 1,400 years using a multi-proxy dataset from Lake Logung, located in East Java, Indonesia that provides insights into centennial-scale trends in warm pool hydrology. Organic matter 13C data indicate that East Java became wetter over the last millennium until ca. 1800 Common Era (CE), consistent with evidence for the southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during this time. Superimposed on this long-term trend are four decade- to century-scale droughts, inferred from organic matter 13C and calcite abundance data. They are centered at 1030, 1550, 1830, and 1996 CE. The three more recent droughts correlate with hydrologic anomalies documented in other proxy records from the WPWP region on both sides of the equator, and the two most recent droughts correlate in time with historically documented periods of multiple, intense El Nino events. Thus, our record provides strong evidence that century-scale hydrologic variability in this region relates to changes in the Walker Circulation. Human activity within the lake catchment is apparent since 1860 CE.  2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

Yet, detailed records of both long-term changes in grassland vegetation composition and diversity, coupled with fire history, are still relatively sparse. In this study, we examine a sediment core from Fox Lake, Minnesota, using pollen, charcoal, magnetic susceptibility, organic carbon (%C), and silica (%Si) records with the aim of understanding grassland structure and function during the Holocene, particularly in the context of vegetation composition and diversity, erosion, and fire activity. Nonarboreal pollen comprises between 37% and 86% of the assemblage throughout the record with the largest percentages occurring during the mid-Holocene (~80004000 yr BP). The pollen record also suggests that at 8200 yr BP, there was an abrupt shift from oak-elm woodland to a more open landscape of grassland or savanna, which remained throughout the mid-Holocene. Additionally, the pollen data suggest that vegetation composition exhibited little change in diversity through time despite recurring fire. Charcoal concentrations varied from 30 to nearly 1200 particles cm3, indicating changes in relative amount of biomass burned, but the morphotypes of charcoal pieces indicate that woody fuels persisted during the mid-Holocene despite the apparent grassland-dominated landscape. Magnetic susceptibility in the sediment ranges from 0.9 to 22.4 (105 SI) throughout the record, with the biggest increase occurring as the vegetation shifted from woodland to grassland entering the mid-Holocene. Organic carbon ranges from 4.6% to 20.0% and exhibits a slow but steady increase after the 8200 yr BP event. Silica decreases slightly but remains generally high between 20.4% and 22.5%." ;

In Central and South America, few studies have been carried out and this study includes a contribution to the group. Eleven ostracode species were collected in Lago Peten Itza (100km2), the second largest lowland lake in Guatemala, and from its inflow tributary, Rio Ixlu in November 2005 and February 2008. Twenty-seven surface sediment samples were retrieved at water depths from the littoral zone to the lake's maximum depth (>160m). Hard and soft parts of ostracodes were analyzed, and each ostracode species was described for taxonomy, size, ecology, biology and geographic distribution. Species recorded include: Candonocypris serratomarginata?, Cypretta brevisaepta?, Cypridopsis okeechobei, Cytheridella ilosvayi, Darwinula stevensoni, Heterocypris punctata, Limnocythere opesta, Physocypria globula, Pseudocandona sp., Stenocypris major and Strandesia intrepida. Most of the species have a neotropical distribution, two are distributed world-wide (D. stevensoni and S. major), and C. okeechobei and P. globula display nearctic and neotropical distributions. We present new records of C. brevisaepta?, C. serratomarginata?, S. major, and S. intrepida in Guatemala. Physocypria globula was misidentified previously in Lago Peten Itza as Cypria petenensis, Pseudocandona sp. was misidentified as Candona sp., and C. okeechobei was identified in the past as C. vidua. Limnocythere opesta is the only endemic species of the Peten Lake District, Guatemala. The most abundant and widely distributed species in the lake are P. globula, C. okeechobei, and Pseudocandona sp. Species restricted to the littoral zones and water depths <15m are C. brevisaepta?, D. stevensoni, H. punctata, and S. intrepida. Limnocythere opesta, C. ilosvayi, C. okeechobei, and Pseudocandona sp. are distributed from the littoral zone to a depth of 40m. Species collected only in the Ixlu tributary and in a littoral zone on the west side of the lake were C. serratomarginata? and S. major. During November, live adult L. opesta and C. okeechobei were abundant, but no C. brevisaepta? or C. serratomarginata? adults were found. Adult specimens of C. ilosvayi were more abundant in February. In general, ostracodes collected were smaller than those reported in the literature. An accurate taxonomy will improve the use of ostracode fossil assemblages in long sediment cores when reconstructing past climatic and environmental changes in the northern lowland Neotropics." ;

The core was taken at 41.95N, 111.31W, near the depocenter of the 60-m-deep, spring-fed, alkaline lake, where carbonate-bearing sediment has accumulated continuously. Chronological control is poor but indicates an average sedimentation rate of 0.54 mm yr1. Analyses have been completed at multi-centennial to millennial scales, including (in order of decreasing temporal resolution) sediment magnetic properties, oxygen and carbon isotopes on bulk-sediment carbonate, organic- and inorganic- carbon contents, palynology; mineralogy (X-ray diffraction), strontium isotopes on bulk carbonate, ostracode taxonomy, oxygen and carbon isotopes on ostracodes, and diatom assemblages. Massive silty clay and marl constitute most of the core, with variable carbonate content (average = 31  19%) and oxygen-isotopic values (18O ranging from 18 to 5 in bulk carbonate). These variations, as well as fluctuations of biological indicators, reflect changes in the water and sediment discharged from the glaciated headwaters of the dominant tributary, Bear River, and the processes that influenced sediment delivery to the core site, including lake-level changes. Although its influence has varied, Bear River has remained a tributary to Bear Lake during most of the last quarter-million years. The lake disconnected from the river and, except for a few brief excursions, retracted into a topographically closed basin during global interglaciations (during parts of marine isotope stages 7, 5, and 1). These intervals contain up to 80% endogenic aragonite with high 18O values (average = 5.8  1.7), indicative of strongly evaporitic conditions. Interglacial intervals also are dominated by small, benthic/tychoplanktic fragilarioid species indicative of reduced habitat availability associated with low lake levels, and they contain increased high-desert shrub and Juniperus pollen and decreased forest and forest-woodland pollen. The 87Sr/86Sr values (>0.7100) also increase, and the ratio of quartz to dolomite decreases, as expected in the absence of Bear River inflow. The changing paleoenvironments inferred from BL00-1 generally are consistent with other regional and global records of glacial-interglacial fluctuations; the diversity of paleoenvironmental conditions inferred from BL00-1 also reflects the influence of catchment-scale processes." ;

Here, we present new data from a well-dated lake sediment core from northern Manitoba, Canada. We assemble one of the richest multi-proxy datasets to date for a low-Arctic lake and characterize terrestrial and lake processes and exchanges between them. These proxies include fossil pollen and diatom assemblages, charcoal, magnetic properties (susceptibility and remanance), mineral grain size, bulk density, organic-matter content, elemental geochemistry, sediment cation (K +, Mg 2+, Ca 2+, Fe 2+/Fe 3+) and macronutrient (P, N, C) contents, biogenic-silica content, basal peat dates (wetland initiation), and stable isotopes ( 13C,  15N). The sediment proxies record both broad- and fine-scale (millennial and sub-millennial) climate change. We find indirect evidence for a cool and dry post-glacial period from 9,000 to 6,500 cal yr BP, a warm and moist mid-Holocene period from 6,500 to 2,500 cal yr BP, and a cool and moist late-Holocene period from 2,500 cal yr BP to present. High-resolution geochemical data suggests 300- to 500-year-long dry periods at ~6,500-6,100, 5,300-5,000, 3,300-2,800, and 400-0 cal yr BP. These results suggest that terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem dynamics in the western Hudson Bay region are sensitive to past climate change and are likely to respond to future changes in temperature and precipitation.  2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

Comparison of the  D wax record with a 19-kyr  D record from the nearby Illimani ice core supports the interpretation that precipitation  D is the primary control on  D wax with a lesser but significant role for local evapotranspiration and other secondary influences on  D wax . The Titicaca  D wax record confirms overall wetter conditions in the Central Andes during the last glacial period relative to a drier Holocene. During the last deglaciation, abrupt  D wax shifts correspond to millennial-scale events observed in the high-latitude North Atlantic, with dry conditions corresponding to the BllingAllerd and early Holocene periods and wetter conditions during late glacial and Younger Dryas intervals. We observe a trend of increasing monsoonal precipitation from the early to the late Holocene, consistent with summer insolation forcing of the SASM, but similar hydrologic variability on precessional timescales is not apparent during the last glacial period. Overall, this study demonstrates the relative importance of high-latitude versus tropical forcing as a dominant control on glacial SASM precipitation variability." ;

During mid-Holocene time, two extended droughts were recorded in the sediment record from Elk Lake at 5385 and 5221 calendar yr BP. A drop in lake level to 14.9 m below the 1994 level and 10.0 m below the maximum 1930s decline at about 5385 calendar yr BP is interpreted for Elk Lake and its water table, based on Heterocypris fretensis occurrence and higher 18O, 13C, and Mg/Ca values. Numerical modeling suggests this \"low-water\" event could have resulted from conditions drier than those of the 1930s drought, sustained over a time frame of approximately a century. The later drought event at approximately 5221 calendar yr BP is marked by a shift in the dominant source of water to Elk Lake from surface run-off to ground water from the till aquifer. The shift in source water is identified by lower 18O values and the presence of Limnocythere staplini. Estimates of climatic sensitivity for Holocene lakes should not be directly based on modern conditions, but must take into account the changing shape of the lake basin through time and its effect on the paleohydrology.  2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Because direct observations are temporally limited, reconstructions of past fluctuations from glaciers that undergo dynamic advance and/or retreat are valuable. We constructed a 300 yr, annually resolved record of surges and terminus fluctuations of Langjokull ice cap (central Iceland) using a novel combination of varve counting, multibeam bathymetry, seismic imagery, and multiple sediment cores from targeted sites in Hvitarvatn, a large proglacial lake. Langjokull achieved its maximum Neoglacial extent between ca. A.D. 1700 and ca. 1930, when two outlet glaciers, Norurjokull and Suurjokull, advanced into the lake and maintained active calving margins. Norurjokull advanced into the basin ca. 1720, and remained at or near its maximum extension for most of the 19th century, whereas Suurjokull underwent a quasi-periodic series of 8 surges between 1828 and 1930, with a recurrence interval of 14  4 yr. Each surge event resulted in fragmentation of the glacier terminus during advances of up to 1.6 km that occurred in <2 yr. Collapse of the expanded ice, iceberg melting, and reestablishment of the ice front at a nearshore grounding line occurred within 13 yr of the surge. Surges converted glacier ice to runoff at 10 the non-surging rate. Our precise estimates of the timing, duration, and magnitude of Suurjokull surges provide ideal targets for the next generation of glacier surge models." ;

This study examines how transient changes in these parameters, as reflected by the redox state of bottom waters, are recorded in the sedimentary record of Lake Malawi. We measured concentration profiles of redox-sensitive metals across a layer of oxidized sediment deposited within a sequence composed of reduced sediments in a core taken at 298 m water depth, ~100 m below the present-day chemocline. By examining a range of metals that exhibit different geochemical behaviors- mobilization under reducing (Fe, Mn) versus. oxidizing (U) conditions; formation of insoluble sulfides (Cd, Mo, Pb, Zn); susceptibility to scavenging onto Fe or Mn oxyhydroxide precipitates (Co, Mo, Pb, V, Zn)-we are able to outline a sequence of events consistent with the formation of this feature: (1) At some time before 11 ky BP there was an episode of penetration of oxygenated waters to depths close to or greater than that of this core, i.e., substantially deeper in the lake basin than at present. At this time diagenetically remobilized Fe and Mn were oxidized and precipitated in a near-surface sediment horizon. (2) Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides that precipitated from the water column as metal-rich anoxic waters were mixed upward into oxygenated waters, were deposited in an immediately overlying layer of the sediment. Such material continued to accumulate in surface sediments for a few hundred years until oxic conditions no longer prevailed in overlying waters. (3) As the depth of the chemocline rose (relative to the present-day lake surface) this authigenic material was, in turn, overlain by reducing sediments. (4) Subsequent diagenetic remobilization at the top and bottom of this 'redox sandwich' resulted in formation of horizons enriched in, U, Mo, and sulfide-forming metals (notably Cd) along the redox gradients both above and, to a lesser extent, below the layer of oxidized sediment. These enrichments, immobilized under reducing conditions, will remain as permanent markers of the episode of deepening of the chemocline even after reduction and remobilization of the oxidized Fe and Mn solids. In addition, such markers may be useful in determining whether observed episodic interruptions in deposition of varved sediments in the deep anoxic basins of Lake Malawi are due to bioturbation brought on by episodes of deeper oxygen penetration in the water column.

The data were collected using two different, but complementary, experimental approaches, one involving classical Fe isotope exchange between Fe in pyrite and dissolved Fe in coexisting fluid, while the other involved homogenous precipitation of pyrite in a redox and pH buffered chemical system. Results from these experiments indicate equilibrium Fe isotopic fractionation between pyrite and fluid, 56FePyr-Fe(aq), of 0.990.29 (2), in 56Fe/54Fe. The experimentally determined equilibrium pyrite-fluid Fe isotopic fractionation agrees with theoretical and spectrally-based predictions. The second series of experiments were conducted to better constrain the effect of precipitation rate on the temporal evolution of the Fe isotopic composition of pyrite and Fe bearing fluids in dynamic mixing environments, such as hydrothermal vent sites at mid-ocean ridges. Rapid homogenous precipitation of pyrite at 300 and 350C indicates that 56Fe of dissolved Fe is significantly greater than pyrite that formed during the earliest stage of the experiment, possibly facilitated by either equilibrium or kinetic isotope effects involving FeS as a reactant during pyrite formation. Subsequent recrystallization of pyrite results in a Fe isotopic fractionation with dissolved Fe that moves towards the experimentally determined equilibrium Fe isotopic fractionation with reaction progress. The experimental data reported here may help to decipher the complex kinetic and thermodynamic processes involved in pyrite formation at deep sea vents, while also providing constraints for the rapidly developing theoretical models used to estimate equilibrium Fe isotope fractionation between pyrite and fluid at elevated temperatures and pressures." ;

A sedimentary unconformity is dated between 34,800 and 23,200calyr BP. During all or some of this period there was a hiatus in deposition indicating a major drop in lake level and deflation of lacustrine sediments. MIS 3 vegetation was herb-shrub tundra; more xeric graminoid-herb tundra developed after 23,200calyr BP. The tundra gradually became more mesic after 17,000calyr BP. Expansions of Salix then Betula, at 15,000 and 14,000calyr BP, respectively, are coincident with a major rise in lake level marked by increasing fine-grained sediment and higher organic matter content. Several sites in the region display disrupted sedimentation and probable hiatuses during the last glacial maximum (LGM); together regional data indicate an arid interval prior to and during the LGM and continued low moisture levels until ~15,000calyr BP. AMS 14C dates from Burial Lake are approximately synchronous with AMS 14C dates reported for the Betula expansion at nearby sites and sites across northern Alaska, but 1000-2000yr younger than bulk-sediment dates.  2010 University of Washington." ;

Spectral analysis of the pollen data identified peaks at 21-22 and 100 ka corresponding to periodicities in Earth's precession and eccentricity orbital cycles. Suborbital climatic fluctuations recorded in the pollen data, denoted by 6 and 5 ka cyclicities, are similar to Greenland atmospheric temperatures and North Atlantic ice-rafting Heinrich events. Our results show that millennial-scale climate variability is also evident during MIS 5, 6 and 7, including the occurrence of Heinrich-like events in MIS 6, showing the long-term feature of such climate variability. This study provides clear evidence of a highly interconnected ocean-atmosphere system during the last two glacial/interglacial cycles that extended its influence as far as continental western North America. Our study also contributes to a greater understanding of the impact of long-term climate change on vegetation of western North America. Such high-resolution studies are particularly important in efforts of the scientific community to predict the consequences of future climate change.  2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved." ;

ns3:daa8f7ce\-8eed\-3a20\-a5ef\-159a53d4fbbc	ns2:abstracttext	"The existence of palm-dominated forests covering the island since the last glaciation and the recent deforestation by humans are paradigmatic in Easter Island's paleoecological reconstructions. The timing and mode of the deforestation are controversial, but there is general agreement that it actually occurred, and it is often given as an example of a human-induced environmental catastrophe with philosophical implications for the future of the whole planet. To evaluate whether this is the only well-supported hypothesis or if there might be other scenarios compatible with the paleoecological data, this paper reviews all the available evidence on past vegetation changes on Easter Island. The discussion is centered on three main points: 1) the alleged nature and extension of the former forests, 2) the taxonomic identity of the dominant palms, and 3) the nature of the recent ecological changes leading to a treeless island. The potential causes of the assumed deforestation are beyond the scope of this study. Concerning the first point, palynological and anthracological results obtained so far are not only compatible with a forested island, but also with other scenarios, for example a mosaic vegetation pattern with forests restricted to sites with a high freshwater table (gallery forests), which are mostly around the permanent lakes and along the coasts. With regard to palm identity, some extant species have been proposed as potential candidates, but the palms that dominated these forests seem to have become extinct and their identity remains unknown. The existence of a sedimentary hiatus around the dates of forest decline complicates the picture and reinforces the possibility of climatic changes. It is concluded that the hypothesis of a previously forested island has yet to be demonstrated. Therefore, the recent ecological disaster, human-induced or not, is still speculative. Several types of future studies are proposed for a better understanding of Easter Island's ecological history, including: modern analog studies from similar situations, pollen dispersal modeling, high-resolution multi-proxy studies along the cores obtained so far, more coring campaigns in the search for older sediments, and DNA and isotopic analyses of plant remains for taxonomic identification purposes.  2010 Elsevier B.V." ;

These lakes are downwind of sources of atmospheric inputs originating from mining, industrial, urban, agricultural and natural sources that are distributed within tens to hundreds of kilometers west and south of the Uinta Mountains. Sediment cores were retrieved from Marshall and Hidden lakes to determine the impacts of atmospheric pollution, especially metals. Paleolimnological techniques, including elemental analyses and Pb-210 and Pu239+240 dating, indicate that both lakes began receiving eolian inputs from anthropogenic sources in the late 1800s with the greatest increases occurring after the early 1900s. Over the last century, sediments in Marshall Lake, which is closer to the Wasatch Front and receives more precipitation than Hidden Lake, received twice the concentrations of metals and phosphorus as Hidden Lake. Comparison of diatom and elemental data reveals coeval changes in geochemistry and diatom assemblages at Marshall Lake, but not at Hidden Lake; however, a major shift in diatom assemblages occurs at Hidden Lake in the seventeenth century. The change in diatoms at Marshall Lake is marked by the near disappearance of Cyclotella stelligera and C. pseudostelligera and an increase in benthic, metal-tolerant diatoms. This change is similar to changes in other lakes that have been attributed to metal pollution. The marked change in diatom assemblages at Hidden Lake indicates a shift in lake-water pH from somewhat acidic to circumneutral. We hypothesize that this change in pH is related to drought-induced changes in input of carbonate-rich desert dust." ;

Sediment drill cores recovered from Lake Baikal provide essential records not only for comparison with oceanic records of marine processes, but also benchmarks which can be used to help interpret other continental records including other lake archives scheduled to be drilled in the near future. Drilling of Lake Baikal made it possible for the first time to have a continental archive with the same scientific and chronostratigraphic integrity as marine records to address critical questions of the Quaternary and Pliocene. The Lake Baikal drilling project (BDP) rapidly progressed from piston coring and seismic reflection studies to conducting the first scientific drilling in 4 short years and to very deep drilling in over 8 years. BDP has taken advantage of the harsh Siberian winters by using the frozen surface of Lake Baikal as a drilling platform. The positioning of the drill sites was selected using seismic and piston coring surveys. By continuously improving the drilling operations and technology, BDP has achieved new core recovery and depth records over the last ten years and become the world's leader in pioneering the recovery of high-quality, extremely long lacustrine sediment sequences from deep water. The success of BDP came at a time of growing interest in lake drilling among members of the paleoclimate community with few recent large-scale coordination efforts to draw upon. At the organizational, technological and financial levels, some recent changes are favorable for the development of a global lake drilling initiative, which could become as successful and efficient as the ocean drilling program.  2001 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA.

Most projections based on modern bioclimatic correlations imply that high-elevation species are likely to be extirpated from their current ranges as a result of rising growing-season temperatures in the coming decades. Paleoecological data spanning the last 15,000 years from the Greater Yellowstone region describe the response of vegetation to past climate variability and suggest that white pines, a taxon of special concern in the region, have been surprisingly resilient to high summer temperature and fire activity in the past. Moreover, the fossil record suggests that winter conditions and biotic interactions have been critical limiting variables for high-elevation conifers in the past and will likely be so in the future. This long-term perspective offers insights on species responses to a broader range of climate and associated ecosystem changes than can be observed at present and should be part of resource management and conservation planning for the future." ;

We synoptically surveyed vertical profiles of peat pore water 18O and 2H from a range of bog and fen landforms across the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands, northern Minnesota. Contrary to our expectations, we find that local-scale recharge penetrates to not only the basal peat at topographically high bog crests but also transitional Sphagnum lawns and low-lying fen water tracks. Surface landscape characteristics appear to control the isotopic composition of the deeper pore waters (depths 0.5 m), which are partitioned into discrete ranges of 18O on the basis of landform type (mean  standard deviation for bog crests = 11.9  0.4, lawns = 10.6  0.1, fen water tracks = 8.8  1.0). Fen water tracks have a shallow free-water surface that is seasonally enriched by isotope fractionating evaporation, fingerprinting recharge to underlying pore waters at depths 3 m. Isotope mass balance calculations indicate on average 12% of the waters we sampled from the basal peat of the fen water tracks was lost to surface evaporation, which occurred prior to advection and dispersion into the underlying formation. These new data provide direct support for the hypothesis that methane production in deeper peat strata is fuelled by the downward transport of labile carbon substrates from the surface of northern peat basins.

The records from these cores include a suite of elements, organic carbon content, fossil seeds, pollen, and stable carbon isotopes. The stratigraphy indicates fresher water conditions than present between 3400 and 2000 cal YBP. A tidal marsh became established at China Camp after about 2000 cal YBP; between 2000 cal YBP and approximately 700 cal YBP, conditions in the estuary were apparently more saline and variable. This interval was terminated by at least three or possibly five flood events, as evidenced by coarse clastic materials most likely washed down from the surrounding uplands. These floods represent high rainfall events, possibly El Nino years, and occurred during the late Medieval Climatic Anomaly. Greater plant diversity and pollen from some species with low salt tolerance are found in a core collected near the upland edge of the marsh and date to about 200 years ago, suggesting fresher conditions than today. Over the past 50 years, the diversity of marsh vegetation has decreased, and salt tolerant plants (especially Salicornia virginica) have become the dominant species. These changes are likely a result of the impacts of water diversions and upstream dams in the San Francisco Bay watershed." ;

Oxygen and hydrogen isotope values of interstitial and gypsum hydration water indicate that the crystallization water preserves the isotopic signal of the lake water, and has not undergone post-depositional isotopic exchange with sediment pore water. The estimated lake water 18O is combined with carbonate 18O to calculate paleotemperature. Three paired measurements of 1200-yr-old gypsum and gastropod aragonite from Lake Chichancanab, Mexico, yielded a mean temperature of 26 C (range 2329.5 C), which is consistent with the mean and range of mean annual temperatures (MAT) in the region today. Paired measurements of ostracods, gastropods, and gypsum hydration water samples were measured in cores from Lake Peten Itza, Guatemala, spanning the Late Glacial and early Holocene period (18.510.4 ka). The lowest recorded temperatures occurred at the start of Heinrich Stadial (HS) 1 at 18.5 ka. Inferred temperatures from benthic ostracods ranged from 16 to 20 C during HS 1, which is 610 C cooler than MAT in the region today, whereas temperatures derived from shallow-water gastropods were generally warmer (2025 C), reflecting epilimnetic temperatures. The derived temperatures support previous findings of greater tropical cooling on land in Central America during the Late Glacial than indicated by nearby marine records. Temperature increased in two steps during the last deglaciation. The first occurred during the Bolling-Allerod (B-A; from 14.7 to 13 ka) when temperature rose to 2024 C towards the end of this period. The second step occurred at 10.4 ka near the beginning of the Holocene when ostracod-inferred temperature rose to 26 C, reflecting modern hypolimnetic temperature set during winter, whereas gastropod-derived temperature attained 30 C, reflecting modern summer epilimnetic temperature." ;

The sequence consists of alternating mud and salt, which reflect shifts between wet and dry periods. Low abundances of aquatic species between 108,000 and 50,000 yr ago (such as Myriophyllum and Isoetes) and marked fluctuations in Pediastrum suggest generally dry conditions dominated by saltpans. Between 50,000 yr ago and 36,000 cal yr B.P., lacustrine sediments become increasingly dominant. The transition to the formation of paleolake \"Minchin\" begins with marked rises in Isoetes and Myriophyllum, suggesting a lake of moderate depth. Similarly, between 36,000 and 26,000 cal yr B.P., the transition to paleolake Tauca is also initiated by rises in Isoetes and Myriophyllum; the sustained presence of Isoetes indicates the development of flooded littoral communities associated with a lake maintained at a higher water level. Polylepis tarapacana-dominated communities were probably an important component of the Altiplano terrestrial vegetation during much of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and previous wet phases.  2004 University of Washington.

Bear River, the largest river in the Great Basin, enters Bear Lake Valley 15 km north of the lake. Two 4-m-long cores provide a lake sediment record extending back 26 cal k.y. The penetrated section can be divided into a lower unit composed of quartz-rich clastic sediments and an upper unit composed largely of endogenic carbonate. Data from modern fluvial sediments provide the basis for interpreting changes in provenance of detrital material in the lake cores. Sediments from small streams draining elevated topography on the east and west sides of the lake are characterized by abundant dolomite, high magnetic susceptibility (MS) related to eolian magnetite, and low values of hard isothermal remanent magnetization (HIRM, indicative of hematite content). In contrast, sediments from the headwaters of the Bear River in the Uinta Mountains lack carbonate and have high HIRM and low MS. Sediments from lower reaches of the Bear River contain calcite but little dolomite and have low values of MS and HIRM. These contrasts in catchment properties allow interpretation of the following sequence from variations in properties of the lake sediment: (1) ca. 26 cal ka-onset of glaciation; (2) ca. 26-20 cal ka-quasicyclical, millennial-scale variations in the concentrations of hematite-rich glacial fl our derived from the Uinta Mountains, and dolomite- and magnetite-rich material derived from the local Bear Lake catchment (reflecting variations in glacial extent); (3) ca. 20-19 cal ka-maximum content of glacial fl our; (4) ca. 19-17 cal ka-constant content of Bear River sediment but declining content of glacial fl our from the Uinta Mountains; (5) ca. 17-15.5 cal ka-decline in Bear River sediment and increase in content of sediment from the local catchment; and (6) ca. 15.5-14.5 cal ka-increase in content of endogenic calcite at the expense of detrital material. The onset of glaciation indicated in the Bear Lake record postdates the initial rise of Lake Bonneville and roughly corresponds to the Stansbury shoreline. The lake record indicates that maximum glaciation occurred as Lake Bonneville reached its maximum extent ca. 20 cal ka and that deglaciation was under way while Lake Bonneville remained at its peak. The transition from siliciclastic to carbonate sedimentation probably indicates increasingly evaporative conditions and may coincide with the climatically driven fall of Lake Bonneville from the Provo shoreline. Although lake levels fluctuated during the Younger Dryas, the Bear Lake record for this period is more consistent with drier conditions, rather than cooler, moister conditions interpreted from many studies from western North America.

Proxies indicate cyclic changes in eolian input, productivity, and temperature. Maxima in magnetic susceptibility are accompanied by maxima in aluminum and iron mass accumulation rates (MARs), and in abundances of the ostracode Fabaeformiscandona rawsoni. This indicates variable windy, and dry conditions with westerly wind dominance, including during the Medieval Climate Anomaly. Maxima in carbonates, organic carbon, phosphorous, and high 13C values of endogenic calcite indicate moister and less windy periods with increased lake productivity, including during the Little Ice Age, and alternate with maxima of eolian transport. Times of the Maunder, Sporer and Wolf sunspot minima are characterized by maxima in 18O values and aluminum MARs, and minima in 13C values and organic carbon content. We interpret these lake conditions during sunspot minima to indicate decreases in lake surface water temperatures of up to 4-5 C associated with decreases in epilimnetic productivity during summer.We propose that the centennial cycles are triggered by solar activity, originate in the tropical Pacific, and their onset during the Late Holocene is associated with insolation conditions driven by precession. The cyclic pattern is transmitted from the tropical Pacific into the atmosphere and transported by westerly winds into the North Atlantic realm where they strengthen the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation during periods of northern Great Plains wind maxima. This consequently leads to moister climates in Central and Northern Europe. Thus, Pickerel Lake provides evidence for mechanisms of teleconnections including an atmospheric link bridging between the different climate regimes from the tropical Pacific to the North Atlantic and onto the European continent.  2010 Elsevier Ltd." ;

The estimated summer temperatures of the Blling/Allerd were as high as those in the early Holocene and are correlated with increasing Milankovitch summer insolation. This warm phase was abruptly terminated in the Younger Dryas cold episode by a depletion of 4 in <sup>18</sup>O, suggesting a summer atmospheric temperature decrease of about 12C, comparable to that inferred from fossil beetle data. The Younger Dryas phase is attributed to a major cooling of the sea-surface temperature by a postulated discharge of icebergs similar to that of the Heinrich events, for the icebergs were much more effective than simple meltwater in cooling the sea surface and thus the climate over Europe. Shorter-term cool phases (Older Dryas, Gerzensee, Preboreal oscillation) are also recognized." ;

Proxies respond to changes in precipitation rather than temperature alone. Our combined terrestrial and marine archive documents a succession of dry and wet periods coherent with the North Atlantic climate signal. A dry period occurred prior to 2.7 cal ka BP - synchronously to the global aridity crisis of the third-millennium BC - and during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (1.4-0.7 cal ka BP). Wetter conditions prevailed from 2.7 to 1.4 cal ka BP. Hydrological signatures during the Little Ice Age are highly variable but consistent with more humidity than the Medieval Climate Anomaly. Additionally, Pb anomalies in sediments at the end of the Bronze Age suggest anthropogenic pollution earlier than the Roman Empire development in the Iberian Peninsula. The Late Holocene climate evolution of the in the study area confirms the see-saw pattern between the eastern and western Mediterranean regions and the higher influence of the North Atlantic dynamics in the western Mediterranean.

Using methods of resurrection ecology, clones were established by hatching dormant eggs from sediment layers of a lake (South Center, MN, U.S.A) that were separated by centuries of environmental change (nutrient enrichment). Two sets of paired clones (modern vs. ancient) were competed against each other in a 2  2 factorial design of high/low food quantity and high/low food quality. Experimental carbon:phosphorus (C:P) ratios were designed to mimic food quantity and food quality parameters respective to each of the two time periods from which the clones were extracted to test whether clones are competitively superior under conditions representative of the time period in which they existed. Contrary to predictions, we found that modern clones were able to outcompete ancient clones under all food treatments. We discuss potential mechanisms (i.e., mutational input, viability of long-dormant eggs, differences in phenotypic plasticity) that may have differentially impacted the performance of experimental clones. Our results should aid in deciphering microevolutionary dynamics observed in resurrection ecology studies, a powerful tool that can illuminate adaptive dynamics of organisms to environmental changes on long-term (centuries-long) temporal scales." ;

Using a database of archaeological radiocarbon dates alongside a network of paleoecological records (sedimentary pollen and charcoal) and paleoclimatic reconstructions, we show that periods of cultural and demographic change in the northeastern United States occurred at the same times as the major environmental-climatic transitions of that region. At 11.6, 8.2, 5.4, and 3.0 kyr BP (10(3) calendar years before present), changes in forest composition altered the distribution, availability, and predictability of food resources which triggered technological adjustments manifested in the archaeological record. Human population level has varied in response to these external changes in ecosystems, but the adoption of maize agriculture during the late Holocene also resulted in a substantial population increase. This study demonstrates the long-term interconnectedness of prehistoric human cultures and the ecosystems they inhabited, and provides a consolidated environmental-cultural framework from which more interdisciplinary research and discussion can develop. Moreover, it emphasizes the complex nature of human responses to environmental change in a temperate region." ;

New pollen records from two classic sites, Anderson Pond, TN, and Jackson Pond, KY, supported by AMS 14C age models, span 25.213.7 ka and 31.015.4 ka, respectively. A transition from Pinus dominance to Picea dominance is recorded at Jackson Pond ca. 26.2 ka, ~ coincident with Heinrich Event H2. Anderson and Jackson Ponds record a transition from conifer to deciduous-tree dominance ~ 15.9 and 15.4 ka, respectively, marking the development of no-analog vegetation characterized by moderate to high abundances of Picea, Quercus, Carya, Ulmus, Fraxinus, Ostrya/Carpinus, Cyperaceae, and Poaceae, and preceding by ~ 2000 yr the advent of similar no-analog vegetation in glaciated terrain to the north. No-analog vegetation developed as a time-transgressive, south-to-north pattern, mediated by climatic warming. Sporormiella abundances are consistently low throughout the Jackson and Anderson Pond records, suggesting that megafaunal abundances and effects on vegetation varied regionally or possibly that the Sporormiella signal was not well-expressed at these sites. Additional records with well-constrained chronologies are necessary to assess patterns and mechanisms of vegetation dynamics during the last glacial and deglacial periods." ;

Evidence for drought largely derives from the drier, less populated northern Maya Lowlands but does not explain more pronounced and earlier societal disruption in the relatively humid southern Maya Lowlands. Here we apply hydrogen and carbon isotope compositions of plant wax lipids in two lake sediment cores to assess changes in water availability and land use in both the northern and southern Maya lowlands. We show that relatively more intense drying occurred in the southern lowlands than in the northern lowlands during the Terminal Classic period, consistent with earlier and more persistent societal decline in the south. Our results also indicate a period of substantial drying in the southern Maya Lowlands from 200 C.E. to 500 C.E., during the Terminal Preclassic and Early Classic periods. Plant wax carbon isotope records indicate a decline in C4 plants in both lake catchments during the Early Classic period, interpreted to reflect a shift from extensive agriculture to intensive, water-conservative maize cultivation that was motivated by a drying climate. Our results imply that agricultural adaptations developed in response to earlier droughts were initially successful, but failed under the more severe droughts of the Terminal Classic period." ;

The basalt-dominated volcanic field spatially overlaps and post-dates voluminous late Miocene to Pliocene rhyolites of the YellowstoneSnake River Plain hotspot track. In some areas the basalt lavas are intruded, interlayered or overlain by ~15 km3 of cryptodomes, domes and flows of high-silica rhyolite. These post-hotspot rhyolites have distinctive A-type geochemical signatures including high whole-rock FeOtot/(FeOtot+MgO), high Rb/Sr, low Sr (0.510 ppm) and are either aphyric, or contain an anhydrous phenocryst assemblage of sodic sanidine  plagioclase + quartz > fayalite + ferroaugite > magnetite > ilmenite + accessory zircon + apatite + chevkinite. Nd- and Sr-isotopic compositions overlap with coeval olivine tholeiites (Nd = 4 to 6; 87Sr/86Sri = 0.70800.7102) and contrast markedly with isotopically evolved Archean country rocks. In at least two cases, the rhyolite lavas occur as cogenetic parts of compositionally zoned (~5575% SiO2) shield volcanoes. Both consist dominantly of intermediate composition lavas and have cumulative volumes of several 10s of km3 each. They exhibit two distinct, systematic and continuous types of compositional trends: (1) At Cedar Butte (0.4 Ma) the volcanic rocks are characterized by prominent curvilinear patterns of whole-rock chemical covariation. Whole-rock compositions correlate systematically with changes in phenocryst compositions and assemblages. (2) At Unnamed Butte (1.4 Ma) the lavas are dominated by linear patterns of whole-rock chemical covariation, disequilibrium phenocryst assemblages, and magmatic enclaves. Intermediate compositions in this group resulted from variable amounts of mixing and hybridization of olivine tholeiite and rhyolite parent magmas. Interestingly, models of rhyolite genesis that involve large degrees of melting of Archean crust or previously consolidated mafic or silicic Tertiary intrusions do not produce observed ranges of Nd- and Sr-isotopes, extreme depletions in Sr-concentration, and cogenetic spectra of intermediate rock compositions for both groups. Instead, least-squares mass-balance, energy-constrained assimilation and fractional crystallization modeling, and mineral thermobarometry can explain rhyolite production by 77% low-pressure fractional crystallization of a basaltic trachyandesite parent magma (~55% SiO2), accompanied by minor (0.037%) assimilation of Archean upper crust. We present a physical model that links the rhyolites and parental intermediate magmas to primitive olivine tholeiite by fractional crystallization. Assimilation, recharge, mixing and fractional melting occur to limited degrees, but are not essential parts of the rhyolite formation process." ;

Here, we take advantage of a site in the Canadian Arctic where lacustrine sediments representing the past three interglacial periods are preserved in an extant lake. We use subfossil insects (chironomids) preserved in this exceptional sedimentary archive to derive temperature reconstructions through the Holocene up to A.D. 2005, through the Last Interglacial sensu stricto (marine isotope stage or MIS 5e), and a portion of the penultimate interglacial (MIS 7). Chironomidinferred temperatures are warmest for the early Holocene and MIS 5e, two periods with enhanced Northern Hemisphere insolation forcing relative to today. Twentieth-century warming at this site apparently caused the recent extirpation of cold stenothermous chironomid taxa. Assemblages from MIS 5e have close analogs in modern training set data as determined by squared-chord distance, and MIS 5e species assemblages are very similar to Holocene assemblages at this site. MIS 7 sediments record summer temperatures similar to those of the mid- to late Holocene, followed by a descent into glacial conditions. Even MIS 7 chironomid assemblages, dating back ~200,000 yr, have close modern analogs. These lake sediments also provide direct evidence for a period of regional deglaciation between MIS 5e and the Holocene (most likely MIS 5a). To our knowledge, the data presented here represent the longest paleotemperature record thus far generated using chironomids. The existence of close modern analogs for ancient chironomid assemblages at Lake CF8 suggests that this method can provide useful paleotemperature estimates extending back hundreds of millennia.  2011 Geological Society of America." ;

Stratigraphic evidence at a number of localities, including new evidence from Crater Island on the west side of the Great Salt Lake Desert, shows that the Stansbury shoreline formed during the transgressive phase of late Pleistocene Lake bonneville (sometime between about 22,000 and 20,000 yr B.P.). Tufa-cemented gravel and barrier beaches were deposited in the Stansbury shorezone during one or more fluctuations in water level with a maximum total amplitude of 45 m. We refer to the fluctuations as the Stansbury oscillation. The Stansbury oscillation cannot have been caused by basin-hypsometric factors, such as stabilization of lake level at an external overflow threshold or by expansion into an interior subbasin, or by changes in drainage basin size. Therefore, changes in climate must have caused the lake level to reverse its general rise, to drop about 45 m in altitude (reducing its surface area by about 18%, 5000 km2), and later to resume its rise. If the sizes of Great Basin lakes are controlled by the mean position of storm tracks and the jetstream, which as recently postulated may be controlled by the size of the continental ice sheets, the Stansbury oscillation may have been caused by a shift in the jetstream during a major interstade of the Laurentide ice sheet." ;

Hydrologic parameters for the model were first estimated in a calibration exercise using a 9-yr historical record (1990-1998) of climatic and hydrologic stresses. The model reproduced observed temporal and spatial trends in surface/groundwater levels across the watershed. Mid-Holocene aquifer and lake levels were then reconstructed using two paleoclimatic data sets: CCM1 atmospheric general circulation model output and pollen-transfer functions using sediment core data from Williams Lake. Calculated paleo-lake levels based on pollen-derived paleoclimatic reconstructions indicated a 3.5-m drop in simulated lake levels and were in good agreement with the position of mid-Holocene beach sands observed in a Williams Lake sediment core transect. However, calculated paleolake levels based on CCM1 climate forcing produced only a 0.05-m drop in lake levels. We found that decreases in winter precipitation rather than temperature increases had the largest effect on simulated mid-Holocene lake levels. The study illustrates how watershed models can be used to critically evaluate paleoclimatic reconstructions by integrating geologic, climatic, limnologic, and hydrogeologic data sets.  2002 University of Washington." ;

A rise in New England temperatures 14 600 yr BP (calendar years before present) coincided with the initial increase in spruce (Picea spp.) populations after deglaciation. Later temperature fluctuations correlated with changes in spruce forest composition until 11 600 yr BP, when evidence for a shift to warm, dry conditions agrees with the replacement of spruce by pine (Pinus spp.) populations. Raised lake levels indicate increased moisture availability by 8200 yr BP when mesic hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) and beech (Fagus grandifolia) populations replaced the dry-tolerant pines. Cooler-than-modern temperatures, however, persisted until 6000 yr BP and appear to have limited the expansion of hickory (Carya spp.) populations. Similarly, moisture-dependent chestnut (Castanea dentata) populations did not increase until 3000 yr BP, when moisture availability rose to modern levels. Pathogens played a key role in a dramatic decline in hemlock populations around 5400 yr BP, but the decline also corresponds with low lake levels indicating that moisture availability may have been a factor in the decline and recovery. Our analysis, therefore, demonstrates that changes in both the abundance of existing taxa and the arrival of new taxa closely correlate with independently documented changes in climate. Temperature trends do not explain all aspects of the vegetation history, but when both temperature and moisture balance are considered, we see that forest composition consistently changed within centuries or less of climatic changes." ;

Here we report a high-resolution and multiproxy paleoecological record from Horseshoe Lake, an oxbow lake in the central Mississippi River valley that is adjacent to the Cahokia site (Illinois, USA), the largest prehistoric settlement north of Mexico. Palynological and carbon isotope data document pronounced vegetation changes over the past 1700 yr driven primarily by land use, including 900 yr (4501350 CE) of sustained prehistoric human impacts. Rapid forest clearance was followed closely by the proliferation of indigenous seed crops of the Eastern Agricultural Complex beginning ca. 450 CE, centuries before the emergence of Cahokia at 1050 CE. Agricultural intensification that included the use of maize (Zea mays subsp. mays) followed this initial clearance, with peak land use intensity between 900 and 1200 CE. A large flood event ca. 1200 CE marks the onset of agricultural contraction and Cahokias decline. Reforestation follows the abandonment of the Cahokia region at ca. 1350 CE. The Horseshoe Lake record thus indicates that regional agricultural activity began abruptly at 450 CE and intensified over the following centuries, well before the formation of Cahokia and other large prehistoric settlements. The evidence that a major flood coincided with the onset of Cahokias decline is noteworthy, but will require corroboration from additional records." ;

Here we explore how the NAO and other atmospheric circulation modes operated over the longer timescales of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and Little Ice Age (LIA). High-resolution palaeolimnological evidence from opposite ends of the Mediterranean basin, supplemented by other palaeoclimate data, is used to track shifts in regional hydro-climatic conditions. Multiple geochemical, sedimentological, isotopic and palaeoecological proxies from Estanya and Montcortes lakes in northeast Spain and Nar lake in central Turkey have been cross-correlated at decadal time intervals since AD 900. These dryland lakes capture sensitively changes in precipitation/evaporation (P/E) balance by adjustments in water level and salinity, and are especially valuable for reconstructing variability over decadal-centennial timescales. Iberian lakes show lower water levels and higher salinities during the 11th to 13th centuries synchronous with the MCA and generally more humid conditions during the 'LIA' (15th-19th centuries). This pattern is also clearly evident in tree-ring records from Morocco and from marine cores in the western Mediterranean Sea. In the eastern Mediterranean, palaeoclimatic records from Turkey, Greece and the Levant show generally drier hydro-climatic conditions during the LIA and a wetter phase during the MCA. This implies that a bipolar climate see-saw has operated in the Mediterranean for the last 1100. years. However, while western Mediterranean aridity appears consistent with persistent positive NAO state during the MCA, the pattern is less clear in the eastern Mediterranean. Here the strongest evidence for higher winter season precipitation during the MCA comes from central Turkey in the northeastern sector of the Mediterranean basin. This in turn implies that the LIA/MCA hydro-climatic pattern in the Mediterranean was determined by a combination of different climate modes along with major physical geographical controls, and not by NAO forcing alone, or that the character of the NAO and its teleconnections have been non-stationary.  2011 Elsevier B.V." ;

As a result, the magnitude of lake response to climatic forcing may be non-linear. In addition, changes in the lake system associated with the aging process or non-climatic influences may alter the response to a given climate perturbation. These non-linear and non-stationary characteristics can produce spatial heterogeneity in the pattern and timing of inferred change. One approach for generating regionally robust climatic interpretations from lakes is to increase coordinated efforts to generate and synthesize large data sets, so that localized influences can be more clearly distinguished from broad-scale regional patterns. This approach will be most successful for evaluating climate variation at multi-decadal or longer temporal scales; the climatic interpretation of higher frequency limnological variation can be more complicated, because of dating uncertainties and differential response times of individual proxies and systems.  2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

A soil horizon developed at the coring site shortly before 12,400 14C yr BP due to a lakewide desiccation event. The radiocarbon chronology of the older half of this core is problematic, but if our estimated chronology is correct, then aridity and evaporative concentration of the lake are indicated by the presence of Thalassiosira rudolfi from > 12,400 BP to about 10,000 BP. Abundant Aulacoseira and generally rising biogenic silica concentrations may reflect enhanced water column mixing and rising precipitation:evaporation ratios ca. 10,000-8400 BP. A lakewide reorganization of diatom assemblages occurred around 7200 BP, when Aulacoseira nyassensis largely replaced A. granulata and after which rainfall and wind-driven mixing became more seasonally restricted. Pronounced reductions in offshore diatom deposition, from about 8300-5800 BP and after 3500 BP, may have been related to declines in the duration and/or intensity of wind-driven mixing. Increased aridity, and possibly deforestation in the lake basin, is indicated after 1400 BP." ;

We applied compound-specific hydrogen isotopes (delta D) and the TEX86 (tetraether index of 86 carbon atoms) temperature proxy to sediment cores from Lake Tanganyika to independently reconstruct precipitation and temperature variations during the past 60,000 years. Tanganyika temperatures follow Northern Hemisphere insolation and indicate that warming in tropical southeast Africa during the last glacial termination began to increase similar to 3000 years before atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. delta D data show that this region experienced abrupt changes in hydrology coeval with orbital and millennial-scale events recorded in Northern Hemisphere monsoonal climate records. This implies that precipitation in tropical southeast Africa is more strongly controlled by changes in Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures and the winter Indian monsoon than by migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone." ;

The primary goal of this project is to evaluate geothermal potential in three distinct settings: (1) Kimama site: inferred high sub-aquifer geothermal gradient associated with the intrusion of mafic magmas, (2) Kimberly site: a valley-margin setting where surface heat flow may be driven by the up-flow of hot fluids along buried caldera ringfault complexes, and (3) Mountain Home site: a more traditional fault-bounded basin with thick sedimentary cover. The Kimama hole, on the axial volcanic zone, penetrated 1912 m of basalt with minor intercalated sediment; no rhyolite basement was encountered. Temperatures are isothermal through the aquifer (to 960 m), then rise steeply on a super-conductive gradient to an estimated bottom hole temperature of ~98C. The Kimberly hole is on the inferred margin of a buried rhyolite eruptive center, penetrated rhyolite with intercalated basalt and sediment to a TD of 1958 m. Temperatures are isothermal at 55-60C below 400 m, suggesting an immense passive geothermal resource. The Mountain Home hole is located above the margin of a buried gravity high in the western SRP. It penetrates a thick section of basalt and lacustrine sediment overlying altered basalt flows, hyaloclastites, and volcanic sediments, with a TD of 1821 m. Artesian flow of geothermal water from 1745 m depth documents a power-grade resource that is now being explored in more detail. In-depth studies continue at all three sites, complemented by high-resolution gravity, magnetic, and seismic surveys, and by downhole geophysical logging." ;

The dominant climate state was initiated at the onset of the Holocene (ca. 11 ka); under this climate state, drought was strongly cyclic, recurring at frequencies that are similar to twentieth century multidecadal phase changes of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. This pattern remained consistent throughout much of the mid-Holocene, continuing until ca. 4.5 ka. After this time the mean climate state changed, and drought recurrence became unstable; periods of cyclic drought alternated with periods of less predictable drought. The timing of this shift in climate was coincident with widespread severe drought in the mid-continent of North America. Overall, the strongest periodicity in severe drought occurred during the mid-Holocene, when temperatures in the northern Rocky Mountains were warmer than today.  2006 Geological Society of America." ;

The MIS 12/11 transition at Lake El'gygytgyn is characterized by initial warming followed by a cold reversal implying similarities to the last deglaciation. The thermal maximum of MIS 11c is characterized by full and remarkably stable interglacial conditions with mean temperatures of the warmest month (MTWM) ranging between ca. 10-15 C; annual precipitation (PANN) ranging between ca. 300-600 mm; strong in-lake productivity coinciding with dark coniferous forests in the catchment; annual disintegration of the lake ice cover; and full mixis of the water column. Such conditions persisted, according to our age model, for ca. 27  8 kyr between ca. 425-398 ka.

Because ostracodes contribute to both extant and fossil lacustrine diversity, they can be used to track evolution in water quality. Living ostracode communities in a variety of aquatic habitats of western Mongolia were analyzed in relation to environmental and hydrochemical variables of those habitats, based on presence/absence data from net samples. The sampled water bodies represent broad gradients in ionic concentration and composition. Ostracode community composition of springs differed from all other sampled habitats, which was also reflected in CCA analyses. Our data indicated that the ostracode fauna of western Mongolia shows a high response to calcium content, alkalinity, salinity, temperature, nutrients, and altitude. Species composition and diversity seem to be determined by solute evolution dominated by Ca-depletion. In general, this seems to be an important regulator of lacustrine ostracode species composition in several semi-arid regions. Binary logistic regression was used to predict the occurrence of the most common species with a minimal set of environmental variables. The resulting models showed on average low performance, and mainly demonstrated the potential of such modeling to predict the distribution of typical bio-indicator species.

ns3:e985fad3\-f57f\-3246\-9c6b\-9fbff6254c6c	ns2:abstracttext	"Lake Chungara(1815S, 6909W, 4520 m above sea-level) is the largest (22.5 km2) and deepest (40 m) lacustrine ecosystem in the Chilean Altiplano and its location in an active volcanic setting, provides an opportunity to evaluate environmental (volcanic vs. climatic) controls on lacustrine sedimentation. The Late Quaternary depositional history of the lake is reconstructed by means of a multiproxy study of 15 Kullenberg cores and seismic data. The chronological framework is supported by 1014 C AMS dates and one 230Th/234U dates. Lake Chungarawas formed prior to 12.8 cal kyr bp as a result of the partial collapse of the Parinacota volcano that impounded the Lauca river. The sedimentary architecture of the lacustrine succession has been controlled by (i) the strong inherited palaeo-relief and (ii) changes in the accommodation space, caused by lake-level fluctuations and tectonic subsidence. The first factor determined the location of the depocentre in the NW of the central plain. The second factor caused the area of deposition to extend towards the eastern and southern basin margins with accumulation of high-stand sediments on the elevated marginal platforms. Synsedimentary normal faulting also increased accommodation and increased the rate of sedimentation in the northern part of the basin. Six sedimentary units were identified and correlated in the basin mainly using tephra keybeds. Unit 1 (Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene) is made up of laminated diatomite with some carbonate-rich (calcite and aragonite) laminae. Unit 2 (Mid-Holocene-Recent) is composed of massive to bedded diatomite with abundant tephra (lapilli and ash) layers. Some carbonate-rich layers (calcite and aragonite) occur. Unit 3 consists of macrophyte-rich diatomite deposited in nearshore environments. Unit 4 is composed of littoral sediments dominated by alternating charophyte-rich and other aquatic macrophyte-rich facies. Littoral carbonate productivity peaked when suitable shallow platforms were available for charophyte colonization. Clastic deposits in the lake are restricted to lake margins (Units 5 and 6). Diatom productivity peaked during a lowstand period (Unit 1 and subunit 2a), and was probably favoured by photic conditions affecting larger areas of the lake bottom. Offshore carbonate precipitation reached its maximum during the Early to Mid-Holocene (ca 7.8 and 6.4 cal kyr bp). This may have been favoured by increases in lake solute concentrations resulting from evaporation and calcium input because of the compositional changes in pyroclastic supply. Diatom and pollen data from offshore cores suggest a number of lake-level fluctuations: a Late Pleistocene deepening episode (ca 12.6 cal kyr BP), four shallowing episodes during the Early to Mid-Holocene (ca 10.5, 9.8, 7.8 and 6.7 cal kyr BP) and higher lake levels since the Mid-Holocene (ca 5.7 cal kyr BP) until the present. Explosive activity at Parinacota volcano was very limited between c. >12.8 and 7.8 cal kyr bp. Mafic-rich explosive eruptions from the Ajata satellite cones increased after ca 5.7 cal kyr bp until the present.  2007 The Authors.

The 40Ar/39Ar and paleomagnetic dates and tephrostratigraphic correlations establish the time spans for the four formations present at Gona: the Adu-Asa (>6.4-5.2 Ma), Sagantole (>4.6-3.9 Ma), Hadar (3.8-2.9 Ma), and Busidima Formations (2.7 to <0.16 Ma). The volcano-sedimentary succession at Gona displays many classic tectono-sedimentary features of an evolving rift basin. The mixed volcanic and fluviolacustrine Adu-Asa Formation is the earliest expression of rifting at Gona, probably deposited in a small half-graben. The Sagantole and Hadar Formations were deposited in a much wave length larger half-graben bounded to the E-NE by an as-yet-unidentified normal fault. The Sagantole and Hadar Formations are both fluvial and lacustrine, reflecting periodic shallow impoundment of a low-gradient paleo-Awash River, perhaps by an accommodation zone north of the Ledi-Geraru project area. Starting at 2.9-2.7 Ma, the character of sedimentation changed dramatically throughout the Awash Valley as bed load coarsened and the meandering paleo-Awash River cyclically cut and filled. Unlike the Hadar Formation, the Busidima Formation thickens westward, suggesting deposition in a half-graben of the opposite polarity compared to Sagantole/Hadar time. Sedimentation rates decreased 5-fold, from 0.25 mm/yr in the Hadar Formation to 0.05 mm/yr in the Busidima Formation, perhaps in response to slowing extension rates and/or opening of the half-graben north of Gona.

We present a paleolimnological test of the model for landscape position and lake response to climate change proposed by Webster et al. (2000). To investigate how diatom communities have responded to drought relative to landscape position, we examined sedimentary diatom profiles extending through the twentieth century from an upland site (Crystal Lake) and a lowland site (Allequash Lake) in the Northern Highlands region of north-central Wisconsin (USA). To explore changes in diatom communities at each site, we developed a calibration set and transfer functions from 48 lakes in Wisconsins Northern Highland Lake District. We further determined planktic:benthic ratios in the two target lakes, developed lake level models, and investigated the sensitivity of planktic:benthic diatom ratios to climatic variability over the past century. In the upland lake, diatom communities responded indirectly to climate via drought-induced changes in lake level, which resulted in shifts in planktic versus benthic habitat availability. This response of diatoms to changes in habitat availability provides an alternative approach for tracking climate change in upland lakes, though careful consideration must be given to the effect of the bathymetry and its relationship to lake level change and habitat zonation at individual sites. In the lowland lake, changes in diatom communities were related to temperature (and possibly lakewater chemistry) and physical changes secondarily. These results are consistent with the model by Webster et al. (2000), with chemical changes occurring in the lowland system and little chemical response in the upland system. However, the biological changes in sediment records presented here provide additional insight into how lake response to climatic change is shaped by landscape position, contributing to a clearer understanding of potential changes in ecosystem structure and function during drought conditions." ;

We note major changes at the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary. From the Last Glacial Maximum until 11.8 calendar years before present (kyr B.P.), Lake Malawi was characterized by either low rates of primary productivity or algal productivity that was dominated by a group other than diatoms. At the onset of the Holocene, conditions similar to those of modern Lake Malawi were initiated, with diatoms and nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria becoming more important contributors to primary productivity. The transition at 11.8 kyr B.P. is likely related to a shift in the dominant wind direction over Lake Malawi, resulting from a southward shift in the mean latitudinal position of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone during the last glacial. Throughout the 23-kyr B.P. record, the effects of wind-induced upwelling are important and may be the main control on the carbon isotopic composition of algal lipids through delivery of 13C-depleted CO2, derived from organic matter decomposition in deeper waters, to the photic zone. Relationships are also suggested between thermal stratification and primary productivity, with cool conditions at 12 and 8 kyr B.P. resulting in weaker thermal stratification and increased primary productivity. The opposite situation occurs at 4.9 kyr B.P., when significantly warmer temperatures and decreased algal productivity are observed. Thus, in lentic systems such as Lake Malawi the major influence of climate on algal ecology appears to be through feedbacks in physical circulation mechanisms.  2009, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc." ;

The lakes show synchroneity in timing of shifts in diatom community structure, but the nature of these changes differs among the lakes. Two of the sites provide highly resolved records of hydrologic balance, while the other two stratigraphic sequences primarily record temperature impact on lake thermal structure. All four lakes show significant change in five discrete intervals: 2200-2100, 1700-1600, 1350-1200, 800-600, and 250. cal. yr. BP. The similarities in the timing of change suggest overlying regional climatic influences on lake dynamics. The 800-600. cal. yr. BP shift is evident in other paleorecords throughout the Great Plains and western US, associated with the transition from the Medieval Climate Anomaly to the Little Ice Age. Large-scale climatic mechanisms that influence these lake environments may result from atmospheric circulation patterns that are driven by interactions between Pacific and Atlantic sea-surface temperatures, which are then locally modified by topography.  2011 University of Washington." ;

Geochemical and clastic sediment analyses from Los Anteojos show that glaciers advanced at ~ 12,850 cal yr BP, reached their YD maximum extent at ~ 12,650 cal yr BP, and then retreated until complete deglaciation of the watershed at ~ 11,750 cal yr BP. The onset of warmer conditions that ended the coldest phase of the YD occurred several hundred years earlier at Los Anteojos than in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. During the peak YD glacial advance, glacier equilibrium-line altitudes in the region were ~ 360 to 480 m lower, and temperature was ~ 2.2 to 2.9 C colder than modern. Independent palynological evidence from the Los Anteojos sediment core indicates that the northern Andes were more arid and at least 2.3 C colder during the YD. The direction and timing of glacial fluctuations in Venezuela are consistent with observations of marine sediment records from the Cariaco Basin that suggest abrupt cooling occurred at ~ 12,850 cal yr BP, followed by a shift to higher temperature after ~ 12,300 cal yr BP. The timing and pattern of climatic changes in northern South America are also consistent with paleoclimate records from the southern Tropical Andes that suggest a southward shift in the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone occurred at the start of the cooling event, followed by a return to wetter conditions in northern South America during the late stages of the YD. The early warming of the tropical atmosphere and invigoration of the hydrologic cycle likely contributed to the shift to increased temperature in the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere at the end of the late Glacial stage." ;

Diatom-inferred lake-level was reconstructed for all sites and compared with other regional records. Alterations between high and low lake-levels were frequent during the past 4000 years, which suggests that shifts between dry and wet periods were prevalent across the Sand Hills. Extended multi-decadal to centennial-scale droughts were more common prior to 2000 years BP, while the last two millennia were hydrologically more variable and climate conditions alternated on shorter timescales. Despite some discrepancies among the five records, the paleohydrological reconstructions refine the Holocene drought history of the Nebraska Sand Hills, particularly between ~2200 and 4000 cal a BP. Many of the observed drought events are contemporaneous with severe droughts documented at sites in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, lending support for the severity and regional significance of these events in western North America.  2011 Elsevier Ltd." ;

The biotic changes recognized in this study largely agree with the hydrological evolution of the lake described previously for the same period. The diatom record shows high sensitivity to fluctuations in both lake level and salinity concentration as a consequence of climate shifts. In addition vegetation results indicate that the area could have played an important role as regional vegetation refuge. Shallow lake conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) were punctuated by relatively deeper freshwaters between 19.3 and 18.6 cal kyr BP and at 18.0 cal kyr BP, as recorded by diatom shifts. A subsequent increasing aridity trend, coinciding with the Mystery Interval (MI), affected the diatom accumulation rates, which dropped to its minimum values between 17.2 and 14.7 cal kyr BP. Particularly dry and cold conditions during the LGM and MI are supported by the largest values of steppic pollen taxa of the whole sequence, which account for up to 40%. However, relatively high values of Betula during the Heinrich Event 1 suggest a plausible regional vegetation refuge. Abrupt cooling and warming episodes within the LG triggered remarkable ecological threshold crossings in the diatom communities, especially during the stadial/interstadial episodes. At this point, the vegetation reflects the onset of warm conditions during the Blling/Allerd with the partial substitution of Betula by Marcescent and Evergreen Quercus, which probably indicates the arrival of temperate taxa to the area and the likely migration of birch to higher altitudes. The Younger Dryas Stadial shows a complex ecological response. Diatoms are very poorly preserved, but aquatic taxa reach their highest values. An increase in Marcescent Quercus during this cold stage lends further support to the hypothesis that this is a regional vegetation refuge. Low lake levels recorded during the EH affected the development and preservation of diatom communities. A delay in the onset of humid conditions for the EH is also supported by the vegetation composition, characterized by the maximum expansion of Juniperus." ;

Both low- and high-latitude teleconnections with insolation, ice sheets, and sea level have been suggested to explain the pervasive aridity observed in paleoecological and geomorphic data. However, proxies tracking the H- and O-isotopic composition of rainfall (e.g., speleothems, sedimentary biomarkers) suggest muted aridity or even wetter conditions than the present, complicating interpretations of glacial IPWP climate. Here we use multiproxy reconstructions from lake sediments and modern rainfall isotopic measurements from central Indonesia to show that, contrary to the classical \"amount effect,\" intensified Australian-Indonesian monsoon circulation drove lighter H- and O-isotopic composition of IPWP rainfall during the LGM, while at the same time, dry conditions prevailed. Precipitation isotopes are particularly sensitive to the apparent increase in monsoon circulation and perhaps also decreased moisture residence time implied by our data, explaining contrasts among proxy records while illuminating glacial IPWP atmospheric circulation, a key target for climate models." ;

Paleomagnetic data exhibit a geomagnetic feature that possibly occurred during the Laschamp excursion (ca. 40 ka). Although the feature does not exhibit excursional behavior (40 departure from the expected value), it might provide an additional age constraint for the sequence. Temporal changes in salinity, which are likely related to changes in freshwater input (mainly through the Bear River) or evaporation, are indicated by variations in mineral magnetic properties. These changes are represented by intervals with preserved detrital Fe-oxide minerals and with varying degrees of diagenetic alteration, including sulfidization. On the basis of these changes, the Bear Lake sequence is divided into seven mineral magnetic zones. The differing magnetic mineralogies among these zones reflect changes in deposition, preservation, and formation of magnetic phases related to factors such as lake level, river input, and water chemistry. The occurrence of greigite and pyrite in the lake sediments corresponds to periods of higher salinity. Pyrite is most abundant in intervals of highest salinity, suggesting that the extent of sulfidization is limited by the availability of SO42. During MIS 2 (zone II), Bear Lake transgressed to capture the Bear River, resulting in deposition of glacially derived hematite-rich detritus from the Uinta Mountains. Millennial-scale variations in the hematite content of Bear Lake sediments during the last glacial maximum (zone II) resemble Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) oscillations and Heinrich events (within dating uncertainties), suggesting that the influence of millennial-scale climate oscillations can extend beyond the North Atlantic and influence climate of the Great Basin. The magnetic mineralogy of zones IVVII (MIS 5, 6, and 7) indicates varying degrees of post-depositional alteration between cold and warm substages, with greigite forming in fresher conditions and pyrite in the more saline conditions." ;

Reconstructions are based on pollen, diatoms, sediment chemistry and isotopes, packrat middens and glacial records and are discussed within the context of Central Mexico, the Yucatan and Northern Mexico, the three regions for which significant information is available. The available data indicate that over the Late Pleistocene and Holocene there have been significant climatic changes in Mexico, although smaller in magnitude than in other parts of the northern hemisphere tropics and subtropics. Maps of conditions at 18,000, 9000, 6000, 5000 and 1000 yr BP are presented. These show that northern Mexico and the Yucatan often show opposite climatic signals, whilst the highlands of central Mexico are more variable. Around the Last Glacial Maximum it seems that the modern summer precipitation regime had collapsed. Northern Mexico, however, was much wetter than today due to increased winter rainfall. Modern rainfall patterns were not fully established until after 9000 yr BP and generally wet conditions prevailed about 6000 yr BP. The mid-Holocene seems to have been a period of great climatic variability with a number of records showing oscillations between 6000 and 5000 yr BP. A period of marked aridity is recorded in the Yucatan and central Mexico about 1000 yr BP. More well-dated, continuous records are needed, especially covering the last glacial-interglacial transition. The changing balance between temperate and tropical climate systems and the influence of the Pacific compared with the Gulf of Mexico/Caribbean warrant further investigation.

We measured D wax and the stable carbon isotope composition of leaf-waxes ( 13C wax), including both n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids, from modern lake sediments and soils across a marked aridity gradient in southeastern Mexico and northern Central America to investigate the importance of aridity and vegetation composition on D wax. In this region the estimated hydrogen isotope composition of meteoric water (D w) varies by only 25, and variability in D w does not explain the relatively large variance in D wax (60). Instead, the aridity index, defined as the ratio of mean annual precipitation to mean annual potential evapotranspiration (MAP/PET), explains much of the variability in the hydrogen isotope fractionation between leaf-waxes and meteoric water ( wax/w). Aridity effects are more evident in lake sediments than in soils, possibly because integration of leaf-waxes across a broad catchment masks small-scale variability in  wax/w that is a consequence of differences in vegetation and microclimates. In angiosperm-dominated environments, plant ecology, inferred from  13C wax, provides a secondary control on  wax/w for n-alkanoic acids ( n-acid/w). Low  13C n-acid values are associated with high  n-acid/w values, most likely reflecting differences in biosynthetic hydrogen isotope fractionation between C 4 grasses and C 3 trees and shrubs. A similar relationship between  13C n-alkane and  n-alkane/w is not observed. These results indicate that changes in either aridity or vegetation can cause large variability in D wax that is independent of the isotopic composition of precipitation, and these effects should be accounted for in paleoclimate studies.  2012 Elsevier Ltd." ;

Most notably, model simulations predicted inconsistent lake responses to precipitation changes due to differences in lake out see page rates and surface area to volume (SA :V) ratios. Greater out see page within model experiments resulted in increased sensitivity to changes in mean precipitation. Moreover, simulations suggest that, in lakes with appreciable out see page, SA :V ratio changes resulting from lake-level variations control the direction of changes in lake water oxygen isotope composition (18O). Specifically, in lakes with a SA:V ratio that increases at higher lake levels, steady state 18O values will increase in response to greater long-term average precipitation. These results suggest that closed-basin lakes with low out see page rates will exhibit a transient isotopic response to stochastic variability in hydrologic forcing but will not strongly respond at steady state to variation in mean hydrologic conditions. Conversely, closed-basin lakes with appreciable out see page will exhibit strong isotopic responses to both stochastic variability and variation in mean hydrologic conditions (i.e., mean precipitation, relative humidity, and temperature control of catch ment hydrologic inputs to the lake). These relationships provide a mechanism for explaining inconsistencies in the isotopic responses of lakes within a given region to hydrologic forcing and demonstrate that semi quantitative models for describing the relationship between lake hydrologic and isotopic responses to climate variability are not appropriate for all closed-basin lakes.  2010, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc." ;

To address this, we present new stratigraphic, sedimentological and geochemical analyses of four radiocarbon-dated sediment cores from the Pozuelos Basin (PB; northwest Argentina) that capture the evolution of this low-accommodation Puna basin over the past ca. 43 cal kyr. Strata from the PB are interpreted as accumulations of a highly variable, underfilled lake system represented by lake-plain/littoral, profundal, palustrine, saline lake and playa facies associations. The vertical stacking of facies is asymmetric, with transgressive and thin organic-rich highstand deposits underlying thicker, organic-poor regressive deposits. The major controls on depositional architecture and basin palaeogeography are tectonics and climate. Accommodation space was derived from piggyback basin-forming flexural subsidence and Miocene-Quaternary normal faulting associated with incorporation of the basin into the Andean hinterland. Sediment and water supply was modulated by variability in the South American summer monsoon, and perennial lake deposits correlate in time with several well-known late Pleistocene wet periods on the Altiplano/Puna plateau. Our results shed new light on lake expansion-contraction dynamics in the PB in particular and provide a deeper understanding of Puna basin lakes in general.

This study uses ground-penetrating radar to noninvasively estimate the vertical distribution of biogenic free-phase gas (FPG) in two distinct peat landform types in the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatland, Minnesota: a near-crest bog and a midslope lawn (i.e., both as defined by surface vegetation communities). Ground-penetrating radar velocities retrieved from common midpoint surveys were modeled using the Complex Refractive Index Model to estimate free-phase gas volumes along one-dimensional vertical profiles. Near-crest bog landforms are characterized by vertical variability in gas content with accumulations along the peat column up to 24% by volume of FPG localized within the deep peat (e.g., 24 m depth). Midslope lawn sites show lower total volumes (up to 12% free-phase gas) and less variability that result in a more even free-phase gas distribution throughout the vertical profile. High-resolution data also suggests the presence of thinner layers (<1 m) containing up to 40% free-phase gas at a near-crest site. Our results suggest that spatial distribution of free-phase gas along the peat column may vary in the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands depending on peat landform. Statistical analysis supports vertical variability of ground-penetrating radar velocity data with a 95% confidence limit. Our results could potentially be upscaled using surface vegetation communities to estimate landscape-scale gas storage potential in peat landforms." ;

Holocene lake water 18O variations are inferred from endogenic sedimentary calcite 18O based on comparisons with historic watershed discharge records and tree-ring reconstructions. Drought periods (i.e., drier winters and/or a more rain-dominated seasonal precipitation balance) generally correspond with higher calcite 18O values, and vice-versa. Early to middle Holocene 18O values are higher, implying a rain-dominated seasonal precipitation balance. Lower, more variable 18O values after ca. 3500 yr ago indicate a snow-dominated but more seasonally variable precipitation balance. The middle to late Holocene 18O record corresponds with records of El Nino Southern Oscillation intensification that supports a teleconnection between Rocky Mountain climate and North Pacific sea-surface temperatures at decade to century time scales.  2011 Geological Society of America." ;

This presently oligotrophic lake is located ~100-km east from the present-day parkland-forest ecotone in northwestern Ontario. Near-shore sediment core transects from Lake 239 have previously shown this lake was at least 8-m lower than present in the mid-Holocene, or ~58% less lake volume in comparison to today. Large shifts were expected in the terrestrial vegetation if the low lake levels were related to climate. The core from Lake 239 shows increases in the relative abundance and concentration of pollen such as Cupressaceae and Ambrosia, indicating a more open boreal forest between ~4500-8000 cal yr BP. Pollen-based inferences of average, summer and winter temperatures suggest that temperatures were on average up to 1-2 C warmer than today, with winter temperatures up to 4 C warmer. The pollen inferences also suggest enhanced precipitation, likely in the summer, but with an overall increase in evaporation and evapotranspiration resulting in reduced effective moisture. To assess regional climate changes, pollen-based reconstructions of temperature and precipitation were developed and synthesized from sediment cores from eight previously published lakes, from which pollen sites were available to both the west and east of Lake 239, spanning present-day prairie lakes to forested lakes up to 300 km east of the prairie-boreal ecotone. All sites show shifts in pollen assemblages that indicate a warm mid-Holocene period; prairie sites west of the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) show mid-Holocene decreases in precipitation relative to today, whereas sites near or east of ELA show consistent increases in precipitation, but with increased temperatures and enhanced evaporation during the mid-Holocene." ;

We examined the relationships among vegetation, climate, fire and lake-ecosystem properties using lake sediment cores from the current northern and southern boundaries of the aspen parkland in southwestern Manitoba. We analyzed pollen, charcoal, sediment magnetics, biogenic silica, phosphorus, grain size and LOI, and dated the cores using 210Pb and 14C (AMS, calibrated). The Jones Lake record, from the southern edge of the parkland, began considerably earlier (~11 000 cal. BP) than the Mallard Pond record at the northern edge (~8600 cal. BP). These sites were characterized as prairie communities with low fire severity and relatively low lake productivity during the warm, dry period from 9000 to 6000 cal. BP. Beginning around 6500 cal. BP at Jones Lake and 3400 cal. BP at Mallard Pond, conditions appeared to get wetter as indicated by arboreal pollen percentage increases from ~30% to 40-60%, concurrent with a rise in charcoal and proxies for lake productivity (biogenic silica and percent organic phosphorus). Similar to previous studies along the prairie-forest border, we found that charcoal increased during warmer, wetter periods with increased forest cover and fuel loading rather than during warmer, drier periods of prairie dominance. Our results underscore the importance of regional changes in moisture, and its effects on lake levels and forest biomass, as a dominant control of the aspen parkland dynamics.

The Holocene records of LT01-2B and NE98-1PC are similar. There are striking differences, however, between the MIS 5e sections of the long cores and the Holocene records. In these records, temperature is probably the dominant parameter that determines the total fossil pollen concentration and is used to time the onset and termination of deglaciation. In contrast, the relative and absolute abundance of specific taxa (e.g. Polylepis/Acaena, Chenopodiaceae) are indicators of relative moisture availability. Although the Holocene contains a period of aridity between ca. 8000 cal. yr BP and 4300 cal. yr BP, it is a minor event compared with the more extreme aridity of MIS 5e. Core LT01-3B showed similar trends during MIS 5e when compared to LT01 -2B, as did NE98-1PC when comparing Holocene records. MIS 5e and the Holocene are markedly different interglacials, depicted by shifts in pollen concentration and taxa representation over time. Copyright  2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd." ;

Large tropical river systems dominate the export of Si from the continents to the oceans. Here, we investigate variations in Si cycling in the upper White Nile basin over the last 15 ka, using sediment cores from Lakes Victoria and Edward. Coupled measurements of stable O and Si isotopes on diatom separates were used to reconstruct past changes in lake hydrology and Si cycling, while the abundances of lipid biomarkers characteristic of terrestrial/emergent higher plants, submerged/floating aquatic macrophytes and freshwater algae document past ecosystem changes. During the late-glacial to mid-Holocene, 155.5 ka BP, orbital forcing greatly enhanced monsoon rainfall, forest cover and chemical weathering. Riverine inputs of dissolved silica from the lake catchments exceeded aquatic demand and may also have had lower Si-isotope values. Since 5.5 ka BP, increasingly dry climates and more open vegetation, reinforced by the spread of agricultural cropland over the last 34 ka, have reduced dissolved silica inputs into the lakes. Centennial-to millennial-scale dry episodes are also evident in the isotopic records and merit further investigation." ;

Sediments with high oxygen demand, such as in nearshore or high-sedimentation areas, contribute disproportionally to benthic N removal, despite covering only a small portion of the lake floor. These sediments are nitrate sinks (average 0.16 mmol m-2 d-1) and have denitrification rates (average 0.76 mmol m-2 d-1) that are comparable to those in coastal marine sediments. The deeply oxygenated (4 to > 12 cm) offshore sediments are nitrate sources (average 0.26 mmol m-2 d-1) and generate N2 at lower rates (average 0.10 mmol m-2 d-1). Ammonium is nitrified with high efficiency (90%), and nitrification supports > 50% of denitrification nearshore and ~ 100% offshore. Oxygen consumption by nitrification accounts for 12% of the total sediment oxygen uptake. About 2% of nitrate reduction is coupled to oxidation of iron, a rarely detected pathway. Our Lake Superior N budget indicates significant contributions from sediment-water exchanges and N2 production and is closer to balance than previous budgets. Our results reveal that sediment N cycling in large freshwater lakes is similar to that in marine systems. They further suggest that denitrification rates in slowly accumulating, well-oxygenated sediments cannot be described by the same relationship with total oxygen uptake as in high-sedimentation areas; hence, global models should treat abyssal ocean sediments differently than coastal and shelf sediments.  2014, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc." ;

Dominant pollen taxa include Celtis spp., Alchornea spp., Olea spp., and Moraceae indicating a moist semi-deciduous tropical forest. More xeric indicators such as Amaranthaceae and Asteraceae together with Poaceae comprise less than 5% of the pollen sum throughout this interval as compared with between 44 and 50% during a lake lowstand at 2000 cal yr BP and at the core top (near modern). The differences between these two assemblages suggest a 25 to 60% increase in annual precipitation during the early- to mid-Holocene as compared to modern (1500-2000 vs. 1200 mm/yr today). Early Holocene sediments in E96-2P are composed of laminated diatom oozes with moderately high total sulfur concentrations (2.8-4.7%) and no authigenic calcite, also indicative of conditions wetter than present. Between 9000 and 6700 yr BP, palynological and sedimentary proxies indicate sub-millennial-scale events related to changes in riverine discharge and runoff in the Edward basin. We attribute the variability in runoff, and hence precipitation, to Holocene variability in Indian or Atlantic Ocean SSTs or to shifts in the relative contribution of Indian and Atlantic moisture sources to the western Rift of equatorial Africa." ;

Here, we provide high-resolution lake-level records from New Long Pond and Rocky Pond in southeastern Massachusetts, which each contain evidence for multiple, sub-centennial-to-millennial scale low stands during the transition between the Late Pleistocene (15.0 ka) and Middle Holocene (ca 7.0 ka). Data from New Long Pond also demonstrate sedimentary evidence for a drop in water levels in the early to mid AD 20th century, when long-term trends in instrumental data show lower-than-average precipitation in the northeastern United States. Local data show the most precipitous declines in precipitation and groundwater levels are concurrent with the most severe drought in the AD 1960s, which occurred during a period of low sea-surface temperatures in the western North Atlantic. Ground penetrating radar and sediment core data indicate five intervals with numerous paleo-shoreline deposits between ca 15.0 and 7.0 ka, similar to the layer deposited in the AD 1960s. Many of the intervals of low lake levels coincide with proposed meltwater release events or abrupt climate oscillations in the circum North Atlantic. For example, we document at least three low stands during the Younger Dryas (12.9-11.6 ka) and in association with the \"9.2\" and \"8.2\" ka events. The combined evidence of (1) concurrent paleo-droughts in southeastern New England with documented North Atlantic abrupt cooling events and (2) recent drought with the modern association of low sea-surface temperatures indicates that freshening and cooling of the western North Atlantic is a viable mechanism for decreasing moisture within the region. Large-scale changes in seasonality and ice sheet extent also may have increased the susceptibility of the northeast to dry conditions triggered by changes in the North Atlantic.  2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Isotope hydrology data from the southern Yukon indicate that the oxygen isotope composition of water from Jellybean Lake reflects the composition of mean-annual precipitation, 18Op. Recent changes in the 18O of Jellybean sedimentary calcite (18Oca) correspond to changes in the North Pacific Index (NPI), a measure of the intensity and position of the Aleutian Low (AL) pressure system. This suggests that 18Op variability was related to the degree of fractionation during moisture transport from the Gulf of Alaska across the St. Elias Mountains and that Holocene shifts were controlled by the intensity and position of the AL. Following this model, between 7500 and 4500 cal yr B.P., long-term trends suggest a predominantly weaker and/or westward AL. Between 4500 and 3000 cal yr B.P. the AL shifted eastward or intensified before shifting westward or weakening between 3000 and 2000 cal yr B.P. Rapid shifts eastward and/or intensification occurred 1200 and 300 cal yr B.P. Holocene changes in North Pacific atmospheric circulation inferred from Jellybean Lake oxygen isotopes correspond with late Holocene glacial advances in the St. Elias Mountains, changes in North Pacific salmon abundance, and shifts in atmospheric circulation over the Beaufort Sea.  2005 University of Washington.

Linear models between the different dataset variables allowed us to characterize the climate signal transmission from one to the other and cross-correlation analyses permitted us to identify the different response times (if any) between them. Principal Component Analyses (PCA) of the limnological and geochemical datasets allowed us to identify the main processes that link lake dynamics, primarily nutrient supply and organic productivity, with some sedimentological processes, e. g. organic matter and phosphorus accumulation. Sediment chronology was established by gamma spectrometry (210Pb). Water input to Lake Sanabria is controlled mostly by the Tera River input and is linked directly to precipitation. Response of the Lake Sanabria water budget to climate oscillations is immediate, as the strongest correlation between these two datasets occurs with no lag time. PCA of the limnological dataset indicated that most of the variance is related to nutrient input, and comparison with the Tera River water discharge shows that nutrient input was controlled mainly by oscillations in the hydrological balance. The lag time between the hydrological and limnological datasets is 1 month. The PCA of the XRF core scanner dataset showed that the principal process that controls the chemical composition of the Lake Sanabria sediments is related to sediment and nutrient delivery from the Tera River and organic productivity. Comparison of the nutrient input reconstructed using the limnological dataset and the XRF core scanner data indicated that the sediments act as a low-pass filter, smoothing the climate signal. It was, however, possible to establish the link between these datasets, and obtain a quantitative reconstruction of precipitation for the 1959-2005 AD period that captures the regional variability. This quantitative precipitation reconstruction suggests it is possible to obtain accurate climate reconstructions using non-laminated sediments.  2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

All three fluxes showed significant relationships with latitude and related climate variables, with lower production, higher evasion of carbon dioxide, and higher burial efficiency at higher latitudes. There was no relationship between raw organic carbon mass accumulation rates and latitude. Our estimates suggest that an order of magnitude more carbon is lost to the atmosphere by evasion than is buried in sediments at a global scale, with total global production, evasion, and burial fluxes of approximately 250, 90, and 7 Tg C yr-1. Finally, the data suggest a trend from autotrophy in low-latitude large lakes to heterotrophy and increasing reliance on allochthonous carbon sources in lakes at higher latitudes.

This lake was selected for a brine-type reconstruction because a previous study using fossil-ostracode assemblages indicated a shift in anion composition during the mid-Holocene (Smith et al., 1997). Salinity was reconstructed using a transfer function developed for the Northern Great Plains (NGP) of North America; the reconstruction revealed that salinity was higher (1.5-6.2 g l-1) between ~4000 and 4645 14C yr BP and dropped to 0.35-1.2 g l-1 after 4000 14C yr BP. The anion composition of the system was investigated by passively plotting fossil diatom assemblages onto a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) biplot of the NGP modern samples to determine where core assemblages fell with respect to brine type. The biplot suggests that Elk Lake was mainly a bicarbonate system, but temporarily shifted to sulfate domination at 4080 14C yr BP. Both the salinity and brine-type reconstructions essentially agree with results from Smith et al. (1997), but the diatom record provides less-definitive information on anion proportions as compared to anion concentrations. Because shifts in the relative abundances of anion-associated diatom taxa generally tracked the ostracode-inferred changes in brine type, we conclude that fossil diatom assemblages can reveal information on shifts in brine type over time and provide insight into brine evolution and groundwater behavior in a lake system.

Bulk-carbonate 18O exhibited large fluctuations between 12.0 and 9.1 ka (dates are in calendar years throughout this paper unless indicated otherwise), probably reflecting the effects of glacial Lake Agassiz superimposed on climatic warming related to large-scale climatic controls. In particular, a 3( decrease in 18O 11.2-10.2 ka interrupted the 18O enrichment of 1 from 12.0 to 11.2 ka and 3.5 from 10.2 to 9.1 ka. This 18O decrease coincided with the expansion of Lake Agassiz. We interpret this decrease as a result of decreased summer temperature and increased precipitation derived from the cold and isotopically light meltwaters of Lake Agassiz. During this 18O decline, Pinus pollen continued to increase at the expense of Picea pollen at Deep Lake, as at other Minnesota sites, providing evidence that climatic cooling induced by Lake Agassiz did not cause a reversal to a Picea-dominated vegetation. The absence of such a vegetational response implies that the prominent Picea recurrence during the Younger Dryas in the southern Great Lakes region was not caused solely by climatic cooling due to increased flux of meltwater from Lake Agassiz into the Great Lakes. Instead the Picea recurrence might have been driven primarily by the westward penetration of the Younger Dryas cooling." ;

Results from numerous AMS 14C dates of samples from four piston cores from Lake Bosumtwi show that an abrupt sedimentary transition from a mid-Holocene sapropel to calcareous laminated muds occurred at about 3200 cal yr B.P. High-resolution analyses of the nitrogen isotopic composition of organic matter across this transition confirm its abrupt nature, and suggest that the change may signal a step toward increased aridity and intensified surface winds that affected western equatorial Africa from Ghana to the Congo basin. Northern and Eastern Africa experienced a similar abrupt shift toward aridity during the late Holocene, but at about 5000 cal yr B.P., a difference in timing that illustrates the regional nature of climate changes during the Holocene and the importance of feedback mechanisms in regulating Holocene climate variability. Furthermore, an abrupt change at about 3000 cal yr B.P. occurs at several sites adjacent to the tropical and subtropical Atlantic, which may hint at major changes in the surface temperatures of the tropical Atlantic and/or Pacific at this time.  2003 University of Washington.

We study the spatial distribution of Hg and its depositional history over the past 400 years in sediment cores from lakes located regionally proximal (90-150 km) to the largest ASGM in Peru and distal (>400 km) to major preindustrial mining centers. Total Hg concentrations in surface sediments from fourteen lakes are typical of remote regions (10-115 ng g(-1)). Hg fluxes in cores from four lakes demonstrate preindustrial Hg deposition in southeastern Peru was spatially variable and at least an order of magnitude lower than previously reported fluxes in lakes located closer to mining centers. Average modern (A.D. 2000-2011) Hg fluxes in these cores are 3.4-6.9 g m(-2) a(-1), compared to average preindustrial (A.D. 1800-1850) fluxes of 0.8-2.5 g m(-2) a(-1). Modern Hg fluxes determined from the four lakes are on average 3.3 (1.5) times greater than their preindustrial fluxes, similar to those determined in other remote lakes around the world. This agreement suggests that Hg emissions from ASGM are likely not significantly deposited in nearby down-wind regions." ;

We compare the archaeological record from Hakenasa cave with the lake record from Lago Chungara sediment cores, located 50 km to the south. By integrating both of these archives in conjunction with regional palaeoclimate and archaeological data, we provide new evidence for the role of changing environmental and climatic conditions in human settlement patterns. The first human occupation of the entire Altiplano occurs at Hakenasa and is dated to 998040 14C a BP (11 265-11 619 cal. a BP), and took place under wetter regional climate conditions. An archaeologically sterile deposit occurs at Hakenasa between 7870 and 6890 cal. a BP. Constituted by sands and gravels, these sediments are interpreted as a flood event. This time period is synchronous with alternating short dry and wet events recorded in the Lake Chungara sedimentary sequence. Human activity resumes and increases in importance at Hakenasa by ca. 6000 cal. a BP. This corresponds to wetter conditions indicated by the Chungara record. Even though the lake record indicates intense volcanic activity over the last 6000 cal. a BP, this had little or no impact on the human population present at Hakenasa. This study shows that even in this extreme environment human settlement patterns do not always respond in a linear fashion to environmental change. Copyright  2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd." ;

These interpretations are largely based on experimental studies that indicate that microbial sulfate reduction is accompanied by a substantial kinetic isotope effect (up to 66), but only at sulfate concentrations >~200M. In this study, we examine S isotope systematics in a modern, low-sulfate euxinic lake (~100-350M) and find that the calculated kinetic isotope effect associated with microbial sulfate reduction (34S) is relatively large (~23.5), but preserved 34S values are considerably smaller (4.7-9.9).34S values in this system are controlled by the fraction of the sulfate reservoir that is consumed during sulfate reduction and the location of pyrite formation. This reservoir effect strongly influences the S isotope composition of sulfide preserved in the rock record such that 34S values increase as a function of sulfate levels, even when sulfate concentrations are >200M and the kinetic isotope effect is expressed. These findings have important implications for reconstructing the chemical evolution of the ocean-atmosphere system throughout Earth history-not just for the Precambrian  2013 Geological Society of America." ;

Hydrologic reconstructions from arid North Africa show an abrupt onset and termination of the African Humid Period. These abrupt transitions have been invoked in arguments that the African monsoon responds rapidly to gradual forcing as a result of nonlinear land surface feedbacks. Here we present a reconstruction of precipitation in humid tropical West Africa for the past 20,000 years using the hydrogen isotope composition of leaf waxes preserved in sediments from Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana. We show that over much of tropical and subtropical Africa the monsoon responded synchronously and predictably to glacial reorganizations of overturning circulation in the Atlantic Ocean, but the response to the relatively weaker radiative forcing during the African Humid Period was more spatially and temporally complex. A synthesis of hydrologic reconstructions from across Africa shows that the termination of the African Humid Period was locally abrupt, but occurred progressively later at lower latitudes. We propose that this time-transgressive termination of the African Humid Period reflects declining rainfall intensity induced directly by decreasing summer insolation as well as the gradual southward migration of the tropical rainbelt that occurred during this interval." ;

Andrew and Heart Lakes are located adjacent to and 5km south of Mt. Moffett on the northern part of Adak Island in the central Aleutian Arc. The downcore trends in radiocarbon ages of macrofossils, the 1963 spike in plutonium (239+240Pu) activity, and a lead (210Pb) profile from Andrew Lake were modeled with smooth spline fits. Tephras were correlated based on magnetic susceptibility, particle morphology, and internal stratigraphy including color and particle size. Of the 19 pure tephras in Heart Lake and 21 in Andrew Lake, ten could be confidently correlated between the two lakes. The composite tephrostratigraphy from the two lakes includes at least 30 unique tephras deposited over 9600 years. Radiocarbon ages obtained from mixed aquatic and terrestrial macrofossils with ages hundreds of years too old were inferred for Heart Lake by correlated tephra ties to the Andrew Lake age model. The eroding tephra-soil deposits that crop out along the banks of Heart Lake, and its large shallow platform, may facilitate remobilization of previously stored sediments. Previous studies on Adak Island of archeological sites and tephra-soil outcrops described five tephras that are correlated with a subset of tephras from the lakes based on stratigraphic succession, inferred age, and physical description. Age-depth models for Heart and Andrew Lakes as well as tephrochronology for Adak Island provide geochronological context for future studies.  2013 Elsevier B.V." ;

Although the general climate evolution of the south Pacific since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is coherent with terrestrial records in southern South America and Polynesia, the details of the dynamics of the shifting Westerlies, the South Pacific Convergence Zone and the South Pacific Anticyclone during the glacial-interglacial transition and the Holocene, and the large scale controls on precipitation in tropical and extratropical regions remain elusive. Here we present a high-resolution reconstruction of lake dynamics, watershed processes and paleohydrology for the last 34 000 cal yrs BP based on a sedimentological and geochemical multiproxy study of 8 cores from the Raraku Lake sediments constrained by 22 AMS radiocarbon dates. This multicore strategy has reconstructed the sedimentary architecture of the lake infilling and provided a stratigraphic framework to integrate and correlate previous core and vegetation studies conducted in the lake. High lake levels and clastic input dominated sedimentation in Raraku Lake between 34 and 28 cal kyr BP. Sedimentological and geochemical evidences support previously reported pollen data showing a relatively open forest and a cold and relatively humid climate during the Glacial period. Between 28 and 17.3 cal kyr BP, including the LGM period, colder conditions contributed to a reduction of the tree coverage in the island. The coherent climate patterns in subtropical and mid latitudes of Chile and Eastern Island for the LGM (more humid conditions) suggest stronger influence of the Antarctic circumpolar current and an enhancement of the Westerlies. The end of Glacial Period occurred at 17.3 cal kyr BP and was characterized by a sharp decrease in lake level conducive to the development of major flood events and erosion of littoral sediments. Deglaciation (Termination 1) between 17.3 and 12.5 cal kyr BP was characterized by an increase in lake productivity, a decrease in the terrigenous input and a rapid lake level recovery, inaugurating a period of intermediate lake levels, dominance of organic deposition and algal lamination. The timing and duration of deglaciation events in Easter Island broadly agree with other mid- and low-latitude circum South Pacific terrestrial records. The transition to the Holocene was characterized by lower lake levels. The lake level dropped during the early Holocene (ca 9.5 cal kyr BP) and swamp and shallow lake conditions dominated till mid Holocene, partially favored by the infilling of the lacustrine basin. During the mid- to late-Holocene drought phases led to periods of persistent low water table, subaerial exposure and erosion, generating a sedimentary hiatus in the Raraku sequence, from 4.2 to 0.8 cal kyr BP. The presence of this dry mid Holocene phase, also identified in low Andean latitudes and in Patagonian mid latitudes, suggests that the shift of storm tracks caused by changes in the austral summer insolation or forced by \"El Nino-like\" dominant conditions have occurred at a regional scale. The palm deforestation of the Easter Island, attributed to the human impact could have started earlier, during the 4.2-0.8 cal kyr BP sedimentary gap. Our paleoclimatic data provides insights about the climate scenarios that could favor the arrival of the Polynesian people to the island. If it occurred at ca AD 800 it coincided with the warmer conditions of the Medieval Climate Anomaly, whereas if it took place at ca AD 1300 it was favored by enhanced westerlies at the onset of the Little Ice Age. Changes in land uses (farming, intensive cattle) during the last century had a large impact in the hydrology and limnology (eutrophication) of the lake.  2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved." ;

Total organic carbon (TOC) abundance varied in concert with elemental and isotopic tracers of organic matter (C/N, 13Corg, 15N), biogenic silica content, total magnetic susceptibility, and sediment lithology. We interpret the down-core proxy records as representing the response of the lake environment, in terms of temperature, seasonal ice cover, mixing regimes, runoff and in situ OM and nutrient cycling, to shifting climate states. These environmental factors in turn drove changes in algal productivity, OM sources, microbial OM regeneration and secondary production, and detrital input. The late Pleistocene (19.710.8 cal. kyr BP) was dominated by fluctuations between relatively warm/dry intervals with high TOC (17.416.5, 15.815.0, 13.913.2, 11.411.0 cal. kyr BP) and cold/wet intervals (16.515.8, 14.813.9, 13.111.6, 11.010.7 cal. kyr BP) characterized by low TOC and high detrital input. The Holocene (10.7 cal. kyr BP  present) was characterized by three abrupt increases in TOC (after 10.8, 8.0, and 3.0 cal. kyr BP) and numerous century-scale fluctuations. TOC increases reflected enhanced lake productivity and OM recycling, and reduced detrital input, in response to changing winter temperature and hydrologic regimes. Inferred environmental changes at SL correlate with other Sierra Nevada paleorecords, and with reconstructed sea surface temperatures along the California margin. Parallel changes in the SL and SST records over the past 20,000 years provide new evidence that continental climate in the Sierra Nevada and the California Current system have responded, on multiple timescales, to common drivers in North Pacific ocean-atmospheric circulation." ;

In this review we summarize the main processes controlling carbonate deposition in extant Iberian lakes located in Mesozoic and Tertiary carbonate-dominated regions and formed through karstic activity during the Late Quaternary. The lakes, relatively small (1 ha to 118 ha) and relatively shallow (Zmax = 11 to 40 m) provide examples of the large variability of sedimentary facies, depositional environments, and carbonate sources. Hydrology is dominated by groundwater inflow except those directly connected to the fluvial drainage. Nine lakes have been selected for this review and the main facies in palustrine, littoral and profundal environments described and interpreted. Clastic carbonates occur in all Iberian lakes due to the carbonate composition of the bedrocks, surface formations and soils of the watersheds. Low temperatures and dilute meteoric waters seem responsible for the low carbonate content of sediments in high elevation lakes in the glaciated terrains in the Pyrenees and the Cantabrian Mountains. Clastic carbonates are dominant in small karst lakes with functional inlets where sediment infill is dominated by fining upward sequences deposited during flood events. Re-working of littoral carbonates is common in shallow environments and during low lake level stages. In most lakes, endogenic carbonate production occurs in two settings: i) littoral platforms dominated by Chara and charophyte meadows and ii) epilimnetic zone as biologically-mediated calcite precipitates. Continuous preservation of varves since the Mid-Holocene only occurs in one of the deeper lakes(Montcortes Lake, up to 30 m) where calcite laminae textures (massive, fining upward and coarsening upward) reflect seasonal changes in limnological conditions. However, varves have been formed and preserved in most of the lakes during short periods associated with increased water depth and more frequent meromictic conditions. Most Iberian lakes are in a mature stage and karstic processes are not very active. An outstanding example of a lake with intense karstic activity is Banyoles Lake where increased spring discharge after long rainy periods causes large remobilization and re-suspension of the sediments accumulated in the deepest areas, leading to the deposition of thick homogeneous layers (homogeinites). The Iberian karst lake sequences underline the large variability of facies, carbonate sources, and depositional environments in small lake systems. They illustrate how lake types evolve through the existence of a lake basin at centennial or even smaller time scales. Hydrology is the paramount control on facies and depositional environment patterns distribution and lake evolution and, consequently, a lake classification is proposed based on hydrology and sediment input. A correct interpretation of carbonate sources and depositional history is a key for using lake sequences as archives of past global changes." ;

Drainages from large proglacial lakes Agassiz and Duluth at the end of the last glaciation helped shape the current valleys. As high-discharge outlet waters receded, tributary streams deposited fans of sediment in the incised river valleys. These tributary fans dammed the main river, forming riverine lakes. Lake Pepin was previously thought to be a single long continuous lake, extending for 80 km from its dam at the Chippewa River fan all the way up to St. Paul, with an arm extending up the St. Croix valley. Recent borings taken at bridge and dam locations show more than a single section of lake sediments, indicating a more complex history. The Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers did not always follow their current paths. Valleys cut into bedrock but now buried by glacial sediment indicate former river courses, with the most recent of these from the last interglacial period marked at the surface by chains of lakes. The morphology of the Mississippi valley bottom, and thus the morphology of Lake Pepin as it filled the valley, is reflect in part by the existence of these old valleys but also by the presence of glacial outwash terraces and the alluvial fans of tributary streams. A sediment core taken in Lake Pepin near Lake City had a piece of wood in gravels just below lake sediments that dated to 10.3 ka cal. BP, indicating that the lake formed as the Chippewa River fan grew shortly after the floodwaters of Lakes Agassiz and Duluth receded. Data from new borings indicate small lakes were dammed behind several tributary fans in the Mississippi River valley between the modern Lake Pepin and St. Paul. One tributary lake, here called Early Lake Vermillion, may have hydraulically dammed the St. Croix River, creating an incipient Lake St. Croix. The tributary fans from the Vermillion River, the Cannon River, and the Chippewa River all served to segment the main river valley into a series of riverine lakes. Later the growth of the Chippewa fan surpassed that of the Vermillion and Cannon fans to create a single large lake, here called late Lake Pepin, which extended upstream to St. Paul. Sediment cores taken from Lake Pepin did not have significant organic matter to develop a chronology from radiocarbon dating. Rather, magnetic features were matched with those from a Lake St. Croix core, which did have a known radiocarbon chronology. The Pepin delta migration rate was then estimated by projecting the elevations of the top of the buried lake sediments to the dated Lake Pepin core, using an estimated slope of 10 cm/km, the current slope of Lake Pepin sediment surface. By these approximations, the Lake Pepin delta prograded past Hastings 6.0 ka cal BP and Red Wing 1.4 ka cal BP.  2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

We analyzed 39 different biological, chemical, and physical variables for lakes and soils. We used a remote-sensing-based classification to determine that the landscape was 21% water, 46% peat-forming lowland, and 24.9% open tundra, and we assigned lake order to all lakes based on the order of the outlet stream for each lake. Lakes were oligotrophic to mesotrophic (median total phosphorus: TP = 11.8 g L-1), N-limited (median dissolved inorganic nitrogen: TP = 1.6), acidic (median pH 5.7), and had moderate amounts of dissolved organic carbon (median DOC = 5.2 mg L-1). We identified 2 principle groups of variables represented by DOC and conductivity/ cations, respectively, that captured major axes of lake variation. DOC, 2 measures of DOC quality (a250/a365 [a proxy for molecular weight and aromaticity] and specific ultraviolet absorbance), and Fe and were significantly correlated with percent cover of lowland forest, but conductivity/cations were not correlated with variation in land cover. Soils were generally acidic (pH 2.7-4.4) and nutrient-poor, and wetland soils contained more carbon and higher concentrations of calcium, magnesium, and other cations than upland open tundra. Landscape position of lakes (measured as lake order) did not capture systematic differences in land cover or lake biogeochemistry. Our results highlight the importance of lowland export of DOC to lakes and further suggest the need for additional regional studies of aquatic-terrestrial connections in Arctic and sub-Arctic landscapes." ;

Sediment core chronology was developed using radiocarbon dates on terrestrial wood and charcoal fragments. Our results indicate that in the absence of large human populations and extensive farming activities, Peten forests recovered under humid climate conditions within a span of 80-260 yr. Soil stabilization postdates pollen evidence of forest regrowth stratigraphically, and required between 120 and 280 yr.

Icelandic paleomagnetic secular variation (PSV) has the potential to synchronize these records. Here we compare Holocene PSV from a well-dated marine core on the North Iceland shelf with PSV from two lacustrine archives with comparable sediment-accumulation rates, HVT031A, a glacier-dominated lake, and HAK031B, in a nonglacial catchment. Geochemically characterized tephra layers combined with unique high-amplitude structures in the PSV records provide secure tie points every 200 yr. Once the records are synchronized, the chronology from the marine core can be reliably transferred to the two lacustrine records. The resultant lacustrine age models reveal large changes in sediment accumulation rate at submillennial scales that escape detection in conventional age models with independent dates every 1 k.y. Sediment accumulation rate changes occur at similar times in both lakes, despite very different catchment properties. Low and regular accumulation rates during the Holocene thermal maximum suggest regionally stable, vegetated catchments, followed by a stepped landscape destabilization during the transition into neoglaciation, culminating with maximum sedimentation rates during the Little Ice Age. PSV allows synchronization between multiple records from nearby marine and lacustrine archives, providing improved age models and a means of assessing leads and lags between marine and terrestrial environments." ;

The recently developed biomarker-based methylation index of branched tetraethers/cyclization ratio of branched tetraethers (MBT/CBT) proxy shows potential as a new method for continental temperature reconstruction, but thus far it has only been applied successfully in ocean margin sediments. To assess whether this proxy is also applicable to the sedimentary record in tropical lacustrine systems, we investigated the distribution of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) in recently deposited sediments from 46 lakes in tropical East Africa. These lakes span a substantial range in surface elevation (770-4500 m above sea level), and thus also a wide gradient of mean annual temperature. We find that, saline lakes excepted, branched GDGTs are universally abundant in the lakes investigated and can be used to predict mean annual air temperature (MAAT) with a high degree of accuracy. However, the existing global MBT/CBT calibration for MAAT based on soils predicts inaccurate temperatures when applied to our African lake dataset. This observation, together with the fact that surface water pH, and to lesser extent, lake depth appear to influence the distribution of branched GDGTs among sites, leads us to conclude that in situ production of branched GDGTs in lakes is likely. The robust relationship between branched GDGT distribution and the temperature and pH of African freshwater lakes makes these compounds suitable for paleoenvironmental reconstruction, however we urge caution in using branched GDGTs in lake sediments to infer past temperatures, unless their exact origin can be determined.

Our analysis uses hydrologic data from the glaciated Crow Wing watershed in central Minnesota, USA, combined with a hydrologic model of transient coupled unsaturated/saturated flow (HYDRAT2D). Analysis of historical water-table (1970-1993) and lake-level (1924-2002) records indicates that larger amplitude and longer period fluctuations occur within the upland portions of watersheds due to the response of the aquifer system to relatively short-term climatic fluctuations. Under drought conditions, lake and water-table levels fell by as much as 2-4 m in the uplands but by 1 m in the lowlands. The same pattern can be seen on millennial time scales. Analysis of Holocene lake-core records indicates that Moody Lake, located near the outlet of the Crow Wing watershed, fell by as much as 4 m between about 4400 and 7000 yr BP. During the same time, water levels in Lake Mina, located near the upland watershed divide, fell by about 15 m. Reconstructed Holocene climate as represented by HYDRAT2D gives somewhat larger drops (6 and 24 m for Moody Lake and Lake Mina, respectively). The discrepancy is probably due to the effect of three-dimensional flow. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out to study how aquifer hydraulic conductivity and land-surface topography can influence water-table fluctuations, wetlands formation, and evapotranspiration. The models were run by recycling a wet year (1985, 87 cm annual precipitation) over a 10-year period followed by 20 years of drier and warmer climate (1976, 38 cm precipitation). Model results indicated that groundwater-supported evapotranspiration accounted for as much as 12% (10 cm) of evapotranspiration. The aquifers of highest hydraulic conductivity had the least amount of groundwater-supported evapotranspiration owing to a deep water table. Recharge was even more sensitive to aquifer hydraulic conductivity, especially in the lowland regions. These findings have important implications for paleoclimatic studies, because the hydrologic response of a surface-water body will vary across the watershed to a given climate signal.  2005 Elsevier B.V.

Many contain detritus and/or unsupported thorium (Th) that degrades or prevents the measurement of precise uranium-series (U-series) ages, and radiocarbon ages are frequently affected by both the reservoir (hard-water) effect and contamination with younger atmospheric carbon. The usual method of testing the accuracy of carbonate 14C measurements, comparison with U/Th ages or organic carbon dates, does not separate the reservoir and modern contamination effects, allowing for only relatively imprecise age estimates in samples undatable by U/Th.We have separated the modern contamination problem and the reservoir effect using a step dissolution technique on a variety of carbonate materials from Mono Lake, California, a long-lived closed-basin lake sensitive to regional precipitation variability. New dissolution experiments focus on the deglacial sediments of the Wilson Creek Formation, which preserve ostracodes and fans and mounds of thinolite, a cold-water, hydrated calcium carbonate (CaCO 3.6H 2O). Stepped-dissolution ages of thinolite crystals and dense calcites increased by 500-1000 years over the bulk age, and produced a plateau of analytically indistinguishable ages, indicating nearly complete removal of modern carbon. Repeated experiments on ostracodes from a single sample showed an increase of >3500 years over the bulk age and >6500 years from first to last step, but ages increased up to the last ~5% of the CO 2 evolved, without forming a plateau. This may be due to the extremely large surface area-to-volume ratio of ostracodes, and inhomogeneous dissolution of the hundreds of individual shells required for the experiments. Further experiments are planned to test the effects of modern carbon on tufa, gastropods, and other shells, with the goal of systematically testing the precision and reliability of chronologies for dramatic changes in lake level in arid regions of the world.  2012 Elsevier B.V." ;

Previous analyses of Daphnia genotypes separated by centuries of evolution in a lake using methods in resurrection ecology revealed striking genetic and phenotypic shifts that were highly correlated with anthropogenic environmental change, specifically phosphorus (P)-driven nutrient enrichment (i.e. eutrophication). Here, we compared the transcriptomes of two ancient (~700-year-old) and two modern (~10-year-old) genotypes in historic (low P) and contemporary (high P) environmental conditions using microarrays. We found considerable transcriptomic variation between 'ancient' and 'modern' genotypes in both treatments, with stressful (low P) conditions eliciting differential expression (DE) of a larger number of genes. Further, more genes were DE between 'ancient' and 'modern' genotypes than within these groups. Expression patterns of individual genes differed greatly among genotypes, suggesting that different transcriptomic responses can result in similar phenotypes. While this confounded patterns between 'ancient' and 'modern' genotypes at the gene level, patterns were discernible at the functional level: annotation of DE genes revealed particular enrichment of genes involved in metabolic pathways in response to P-treatments. Analyses of gene families suggested significant DE in pathways already known to be important in dealing with P-limitation in Daphnia as well as in other organisms. Such observations on genotypes of a single natural population, separated by hundreds of years of evolution in contrasting environmental conditions before and during anthropogenic environmental changes, highlight the important role of transcriptional mechanisms in the evolutionary responses of populations." ;

These deposystems are poorly characterized in modern retroarcs, placing limits on our ability to interpret environmental signals from ancient deposits. To address this problem, we have synthesized our existing knowledge about the distribution, morphometrics, and sedimentary geochemical characteristics of tectonically formed lakes in the central Andean retroarc. Large, active mountain belts such as the Andes frequently create an excess of sediment, to the point that modeling and observational data both suggest their adjacent retroarc basins will be rapidly overfilled by sediments. Lake formation, requiring topographic closure, demands special conditions such as topographic isolation and arid climatic conditions to reduce sediment generation, and bedrock lithologies that yield little siliciclastic sediment. Lacustrine deposition in the modern Andean retroarc has different characteristics in the six major morphotectonic zones discussed. (1) High-elevation hinterland basins of the arid Puna-Altiplano Plateau frequently contain underfilled and balanced-filled lakes that are potentially long-lived and display relatively rapid sedimentation rates. (2) Lakes are rare in piggyback basins, although a transition zone exists where basins that originally formed as piggybacks are transferred to the hinterland through forward propagation of the thrust belt. Here, lakes are moderately abundant and long-lived and display somewhat lower sedimentation rates than in the hinterland. (3) Wedge-top and (4) foredeep deposystems of the Andean retroarc are generally overfilled, and lakes are small and ephemeral. (5) Semihumid Andean backbulge basins contain abundant small lakes, which are moderately long-lived because of underfilling by sediment and low sedimentation rates. (6) Broken foreland lakes are common, typically underfilled, large, and long-lived playa or shallow systems." ;

Sites along this belt transect exhibit mostly linear relationships between cumulative mass and age. Long-term rates of peat accumulation range from 16 to 80 gm-2year-1, with a median rate of 47 gm-2year-1 and a mean rate of 50 gm-2year-1. Rate of accumulation is inversely correlated with mean annual precipitation, but is not correlated with the area of the peat basin, basal age, or mean annual temperature. Four of the five highest rates are from relatively dry midcontinental locations in North Dakota and Minnesota; the other is for a coastal site in Newfoundland. The two lowest rates are from extremely rainy sites on Pleasant Island in the Alaskan panhandle. Individual accumulation rates between adjacent dates are quite variable within the peat cores, and across the transect, they do not correlate significantly with immediately previous rates. The same is true of the four sites with the greatest numbers of dates. There is a small but significant negative correlation within the Red Lake Peatland." ;

In 2005 an international team of scientists collected a series of scientific drill cores from Lake Malawi, the first long and continuous, high-fidelity records of tropical climate change from interior East Africa. The paleoclimate records, which include lithostratigraphic, geochemical, geophysical and paleobiological observations documented in this special issue of Palaeo3, indicate an interval of high-amplitude climate variability between 145,000 and ~60,000years ago, when several severe arid intervals reduced Lake Malawi's volume by more than 95%. These intervals of pronounced tropical African aridity in the early Late Pleistocene around Lake Malawi were much more severe than the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), a well-documented period of drought in equatorial and Northern Hemisphere tropical east Africa. After 70,000years ago climate shifted to more humid conditions and lake levels rose. During this latter interval however, wind patterns shifted rapidly, and perhaps synchronously with high-latitude shifts and changes in thermohaline circulation. This transition to wetter, more stable conditions coincided with diminished orbital eccentricity, and a reduction in precession-dominated climatic extremes. The observed climate mode switch to decreased environmental variability is consistent with terrestrial and marine records from in and around tropical Africa.  2010 Elsevier B.V." ;

We used 14 sediment measures from 20 lake cores in a climatically sensitive region of the prairie-forest border in southern Minnesota to (1) assess relationships between modern lake productivity (Carlson's Trophic State Index [TSI]), modern land-use, catchment, and lake morphometry, and (2) contrast regional responses to climatic transitions from the 'Medieval Climatic Anomaly'(1000-1350) to the 'Little Ice Age' (1350-1800) to 'Modern'(~1980-1996 AD). TSI was significantly positively correlated with modern sedimentation rate, and accumulation rates of organic matter (OM), biogenic silica (BSi), and total phosphorus (TP). TSI was not significantly correlated with \"modern\" land cover, catchment, or lake morphometry characteristics, but total organic N(N) was negatively correlated with percent cultivation in the catchment area and negatively correlated with 15N of bulk organic matter in sediment. Regional, among-lake heterogeneity was high over the past 1,000 years, but Little Ice Age (LIA) cooling appeared to result in an approximately 20% decline in OM, BSi and TP accumulation, while warming and cultural eutrophication of the past 150 years corresponded to a 200-400% increase in accumulation rates as well as an 80% increase in carbonates and a small but significant 10% drop in C/N ratios consistent with greater in-lake productivity. Our results indicate that climate does have regional effects on lake ecosystems but that among-lake variability is high, reflecting the importance of local factors and suggesting a need for (1) more explicit definition of what 'regional' means, (2) a focus on degree as well as direction of change, and (3) estimating accumulation rates based on multiple lakes and multiple cores within lakes.  2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V." ;

Shifts in vegetation composition and abundance in the study area during the Pleistocene were indicated in core sediments by marked fluctuations in the pollen frequencies of pines, junipers, and, to a lesser extent, of big sagebrush, composites, and chenopods/amaranths. The modern vegetation distribution and modern pollen rain on the eastern flank of the Sierra Nevada indicate that maximal abundances of these taxa generally characterize higher elevation subalpine and montane coniferous forests, lower elevation coniferous woodland, steppe, and desert scrub environments. Pollen frequencies in the upper part of core OL-92 corroborate vegetational trends documented previously from late Wisconsin and Holocene Neotoma middens in the Great Basin. These trends and evidence from this study suggest that woodland taxa expanded their range down the slope of the eastern flank of the Sierra Nevada and were established in (and immediately adjacent to) Owens Valley during moderated climates of the late Wisconsin, apparently in response to decreases in temperature and increases in precipitation, but retreated upslope toward their present position starting as long ago as ca. 20 ka. More importantly, pollen evidence from core OL-92 documents that the southern Sierra Nevada has experienced nine major cool-to-warm vegetation shifts (in addition to the late Wisconsin-early Holocene warming) during the time interval spanning the middle Pleistocene to early Holocene (Brunhes Normal Polarity Chron). We believe that at least six consecutive cool-to-warm shifts (the most recent ones) represent transitions from full-glacial to full-interglacial conditions on the basis of the magnitude of vegetation change in this portion of the pollen record. These marked changes in the frequency curves of dominant palynomorph taxa enabled us to identify boundaries that define 19 (?20) pollen zones in OL-92. The excursions of the pollen frequency curves within and across zone boundaries approximate the nature, duration, and timing of the middle and late Pleistocene climatic trends documented by geochemical (18O) evidence from OL-92 and from Devils Hole (DH-11) in the Amargosa Desert of Nevada." ;

We measured the carbon isotopic composition of terrestrial leaf waxes (13Cwax) in new sediment cores from Lake Matano to understand regional variations in vegetation and their interactions with local and high latitude climate forcings during the past 53 kyr. Variations in 13Cwax record the expansion and contraction of C3 versus C4 vegetation as well as changes in plants' carbon and water use efficiency and, by inference, regional hydroclimate. During Marine Isotope Stages 1 and 3, more negative 13Cwax values indicate that closed-canopy C3 rainforests predominated in Sulawesi, reflecting a wetter, less seasonal climate. In contrast, more positive 13Cwax values record a terrestrial ecosystem with more abundant open canopy vegetation and possible expansion of C4 grasses between 29 and 14 ka BP, indicating that during Marine Isotope Stage 2, including the Last Glacial Maximum, the climate was more arid, likely with increased precipitation seasonality, in central Sulawesi. Comparison of our record with other paleovegetation and paleohydrological records from Sulawesi and nearby islands suggests coherent long-term hydrological changes in central Indonesia that appear to be sensitive to high latitude climate across glacial-interglacial boundaries. However, variations in the amplitude of the response of vegetation to these glacial-interglacial forcings highlight the importance of regional topographic control on climate and vegetation and suggest an important role for higher elevations in maintaining rainforest refugia during regionally arid time intervals when C4 savannas and grasslands expanded at lower elevations." ;

We used visible reflectance spectroscopy to measure chlorophyll content (and its derivatives) in a sediment core from Kurupa Lake, north-central Brooks Range, Alaska, to reconstruct summer temperature and the number of annual non-freezing days over the past 5.7 ka. A calibration-in-time approach was used to convert downcore changes in chlorophyll content to the climate variables, and an ensemble approach was used to integrate age and calibration uncertainties. The strongest correlation (r median = 0.69, p median = 0.02, RMSEP = 1.9C) is for summer (June through September) temperature using the 20th Century Reanalysis Project dataset. The chlorophyll-inferred 3-year-mean summer temperature shows that the warmest century (3.02.9 ka BP) was about 3.0C (90% range of the ensemble members = 2.34.0C) higher and that the coldest century (1.41.3 ka BP) was about 5.5C lower (90% range = 7.6C to 5.0C) than during the reference period (AD 19611990). Century-to-century temperature changes over the past 5.7 ka at Kurupa Lake have been large (90% range = 2.8C to 3.1C shifts in centennial mean), including the shift between the 19th and 20th centuries, which was above the 90th percentile of temperature changes across all representations of the reconstruction. In contrast to most Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstructions, Kurupa Lake shows no overall millennial-scale cooling trend. We suggest that increased summer duration (by 4.3 days during the last 6 ka) along with no long-term increase in sea-ice cover over the adjacent Chukchi Sea counter-balanced the influence of decreased insolation intensity on the aquatic productivity in Kurupa Lake." ;

These oscillations are indicative of climate-fuel-fire cycles that have prevailed on the Northern Great Plains (NGP) for most of the late Holocene. High charcoal flux occurred during past moist intervals when grass cover was extensive and fuel loads were high, whereas reduced charcoal flux characterized the intervening droughts when grass cover, and hence fuel loads, decreased, illustrating that fire is not a universal feature of the NGP through time but oscillates with climate. Spectral and wavelet analyses reveal that the cycles have a periodicity of approximately = 160 yr, although secular trends in the cycles are difficult to identify for the entire Holocene because the periodicity in the early Holocene ranged between 80 and 160 yr. Although the cycles are evident for most of the last 4,500 yr, their occasional muting adds further to the overall climatic complexity of the plains. These findings clearly show that the continental interior of North America has experienced short-term climatic cycles accompanied by a marked landscape response for several millennia, regularly alternating between dual landscape modes. The documentation of cycles of similar duration at other sites in the NGP, western North America, and Greenland suggests some degree of regional coherence to climatic forcing. Accordingly, the effects of global warming from increasing greenhouse gases will be superimposed on this natural variability of drought." ;

The upper cloud belt has two possible futures: one hypothesis postulates a 'lifting cloud base', raising both the upper and lower ends of the cloud belt; the other expects the upper end of the cloud belt will change independently, with a 'shifting TWI'. We used a 5900-year-long palaeorecord of vegetation and fire from a small forest hollow at 2455 m in the Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic. The site sits near the upper limit of TMCF taxa and the TWI and allows us to evaluate the relationship between vegetation dynamics and two potential drivers of TWI elevation - the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Vegetation changed from cloud forest (5900-5500 cal. years BP) to alpine grassland (4300-1300 cal. years BP), to pine savanna (1300-600 cal. years BP) and finally to closed pine forest (after 600 cal. years BP). Habitat distribution models for TMCF and pine forest taxa show that these state changes were strongly associated with position of the ITCZ (cloud forest xR<sup>2</sup> = 0.63; pine forest xR<sup>2</sup> = 0.53), providing support for the shifting TWI hypothesis. We find a negative relationship between fire and TMCF and a hump-shaped relationship between fire activity and pine. Synthesis. Shifts up- and downslope of the upper limit of the cloud belt over the last 5900 years produced major vegetation changes. Fire also played a significant role, in particular when pine occupied the site after 1300 years ago and from 1965 AD when fire suppression led to a rapid return of cloud forest taxa. Our results strongly suggest that latitudinal shifts in the ITCZ position have controlled the upper limit of cloud forest in the Caribbean and understanding how the ITCZ will respond to climate change will be critical for tropical montane conservation strategies. Shifts up- and downslope of the cloud belt's upper limit over the last 5900 years produced major vegetation changes on high mountains in the Caribbean. Habitat distribution models show that vegetation state changes were strongly linked to latitudinal position of the ITCZ, providing support for the shifting TWI hypothesis over a lifting cloud base hypothesis for tropical high elevations." ;
