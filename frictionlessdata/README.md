# Frictionless Data

### About
Just some initiall exploreation of the Frictionless data approach.  I am using 
the Go Lang libraries which are not as mature if seems as the Python libraries.  
However, there is recent work going on with the Go libraries so that is nice.

Data Package:  http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/

### Python
The python tools are far more mature.   Ref: https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage-py 

```
pip install datapackage
```


### Notes
```
go run main.go pack ./testdata/
```
