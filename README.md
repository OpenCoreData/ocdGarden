# ocdGarden
###### Things are planted here.  Some grow ... most do not.  The ones that do grow are picked and used in other OCD repos.

### About
This is a collection of tests and ideas.  Many of these go nowhere, you should probably not look at them.

However, I have placed there here so I can share this with a few select people and get ideas
and suggestions from them.   I will try and provide at least a few comments in this 
README over time so that a least of few of these are described.

I call it a garden since I plant ideas here..  many do no grow or bear fruit.  Some, however, 
do and ideas that grow up here get harvested for use in the other OCD code repos.  

Many of these come from discussion or examples from others in the community.  I have not done
a good job of noting this, though I do try.  I will work to improve the links to the external 
resources so that people can track down the real source of various snippets or ideas. 

### JanusCSV2Graph
This program is a simple program to read in some CSV files made by Pat Diver and generate
an RDF file.  I generate the file in Turtle using a simple text/template approach.  However 
there is a Go based RDF package I have used in other places.  I should likely use it here too.

### hdf5
Just playing with HDF5 a bit in Go.  I thought it might be interesting to make HDF5 files of 
data for people to use in things like iPython.  

### ocaNillTest
Some test code to address an issue around nill in with the Oracle driver

### mongoAggregations
A collection of aggregation codes used at one point in the MongoDB instance

### graphql
Playing with graphql some.
